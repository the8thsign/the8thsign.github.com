My <strong>Tivo </strong>HDD looks to be on its way out. LiveTV and menus are starting to stutter. Its not really bad yet so I unplugged it and I'll upgrade to a <strong>120GB HDD</strong> this weekend and hopefully i can pull all my recordings and preferences over. If not, on well. guess I'll just have to start over.
