Looks like the Xbox will stop production in the near future to make way for Xbox360. I'll be interested to see how this plays out in the years to come. With Xbox having a HDD inside, hardware failures should be more common than consoles without. Finding an replacement Xbox might be a real big problem down the road. Nothing is set in stone yet but it looks like 360 isnt going to be backwards compatible either so, if you want to continue to play your Xbox games, might have to stock up on an extra while you can.
