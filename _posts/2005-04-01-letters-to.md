Someone on kayhanley.com forums was offering up "the dilettantes" <em>hearts &amp; flowers EP</em> for $12 via paypal so i picked one up being curious what Kay was up too these days. Well, it came in today and the cd is omfg great. Just great pop rock melodies and lyrics. Only 6 songs and I'm drooling for more. And to top it all off, the cover was signed by both Kay and Michelle. Rock fuckin on.
