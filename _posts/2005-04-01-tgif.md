Finished installing my new 200G HD into my Tivo today. Took 8-9 hours to copy over everything. Most of the shit on there was expendable but i had a couple 2hr specials about video games and comics i didn't have time to TTG off so just said fuck it and bring everything over.

For shits and giggles i decided to run my old HDD that was giving me problems thought the manufactures diagnostics software. Well, all tests came back with no errors. Now i don't know wtf was going on and I'm kinda worried I'm going to have the same problems when i hook the tivo back up to my receiver. I'll be home in 5hrs to find out. In the mean time I'm testing my new 226hr Tivo by watching Office Space at work. TGIF.
