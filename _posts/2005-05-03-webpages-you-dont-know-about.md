Here are a few websites you probably don't know about but should.

1) <strong>Digg - <a href="http://www.digg.com">http://www.digg.com</a></strong>
<em>"Digg is a technology news website that gives editorial control back to the community. Most technology websites allow users to suggest content by submitting links or stories to an editor.  If the editor believes the story to be relevant to the masses, he or she moves the story to the homepage. With digg, users also submit links for review.  But rather than allowing an editor to decide which links go on the homepage, the users do."</em>

Basically what these means is that users submit stories then users "digg" them.  If a story is dug enough it gets moved from the digg area to the front page and into its category page.  I find myself getting almost all my tech based news from digg these days. Whats nice is you will pick up some less "newsworthy" stories that you might miss on the big sites. At the very least, throw a LiveBookmark in Firefox of the frontpage news.

2) <strong>Audioscrobbler - <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com">http://www.audioscrobbler.com</a></strong>
<em>"Audioscrobbler is a computer system that builds up a detailed profile of your musical taste. After installing an Audioscrobbler Plugin, your computer sends the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler Server. With this information, the Audioscrobbler server builds you a 'Musical Profile'. Statistics from your Musical Profile are shown on your Audioscrobbler User Page, available for everyone to view.</em>

<em>There are lots of people using Audioscrobbler, but you probably won't be interested in most of them. The Audioscrobbler Server calculates which people are most similar to you, based on shared musical taste, so you can take a look at what your peers are listening to.</em>

<em>With this information, Audioscrobbler is able to automatically generate suggestions for new songs/artists you might like. These suggestions are based on the same principles as Amazon's "People who bought this also bought X,Y,Z", but because the Audioscrobbler data is what people are actually listening to, the suggestions tend to make more sense than Amazon.</em>

<em>It's not just pure statistics and recommendations, there are active forums, groups, weekly charts... The system is being worked on full time, and we plan to roll out many more exciting features. "</em>

Audioscrobbler is a neat little opensource project. You install a plugin from there site into your favorite media player and from then every song you play is sent to audioscrobbler and compiles everything for you on your own user page. Such stuff as Recently Played, Top Artists and Top Tracks are all compiled for you. From these you are shown your Musical Neighbors which are other users that have similar musical tastes as you. There are forums for bands, topics, songs. Pretty cool to just see what your listening habits are.

3) <strong>Bloglines - <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">http://www.bloglines.com</a></strong>
<em>"Bloglines is a FREE online service for searching, subscribing, creating and sharing news feeds, blogs and rich web content.
