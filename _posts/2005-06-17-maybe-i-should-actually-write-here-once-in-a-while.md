Not unlike the security of PC, web and tech based stuff; security in our world is...... lacking to say the least. I went to the Post office in my town today to get a PO Box. They gave me an application and told me I'll need two forms of ID, one with a picture ID. OK, pretty standard. So I go have lunch then return to the Post office with my application. Talk to the same lady and she asks for my two forms of ID. Shit, forgot one. Oh well, must be something in my wallet that will appease the wildebeest of a woman behind the counter. So I pull out my license and a 2nd expired license. I knew the expired license wasn�t going to work but lo and behold she accepted it. BOO-YA MFer.

So she�s filling in all the gray area goodies i need to get going. She�s just about to initial it off then says, "None of these IDs have your current address on them." Well fuck lady, my license is good for 7 years and I have moved every year for the last 5. At this point i ask, WTF you want from me, I moved. I'm then told i need to get a sticker for the back of it that has my new address on it. From moving 5 times in as many years, i am quite familiar with said stickers. My current license has one as a matter of fact, just my last address.

So off I go to the Police Department to get me my little DMV sticker. Ring the phone and the lady points to a display right outside with a stack of them. Well shit, isn�t that convenient. So i grab two, go to my car and put two stickers on my two license's and write my address on them. Back to the Post Office.

Now we're back at the Post office armed with my legit ID now and i have a new lady to process my goodies. So I pull out my app and my two licenses and give them to her. She writes some shit down then asks for my 2nd form of ID. WTF lady, right in front of you, both picture ID's to boot. Wtf else you want from me. SO i nicely tell show her the 2nd form on the desk in front of her and she remarks something about cant be 2 licenses.

Well why not?! So she asks the other lady who started mine and she tells her "Why not, it says 2 forms of ID" RIGHT ON!! Then it happens, she opens her mouth once again and says "..unless ones expired". Ahh horse shit.

Now tell me something, what the fuck is so wrong with an expired driver�s license!?!? Its and EXPIRED DRIVERS LICENSE, meaning I cant use it to drive!! It doesn�t mean my identity is expired! Christ. I will never Understand the expired drivers license BS. Anyways...

So i run to my car and grab everything out of my glove compartment and just hand it to her everything hoping the holy grail of ID is mixed in with the pile of official car paperwork. She pulls my registration and says this will do. Finally. Done. Keep in mind my registration is still under my old address too. WTF.

So to recap kids,

1) a piece of paper with the wrong address on it is more valid than an expired picture ID with the right address on it.

2) A freely available sticker is all you need to make your address official.

Seriously, this is the same as if I have a Credit Card with out a signature and you sign it right in front of the clerk. How is that secure?!?!
