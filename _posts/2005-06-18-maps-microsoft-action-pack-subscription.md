Rumor has it, Microsoft is going to be making changes to there Action Pack subscription for registered Partners. For those of you know donï¿½t know about this unsung gem, basically you register with Microsoft as a partner (free) and pay $299 initially then $199 yearly renewal to get Microsoft's entire (almost) software library. My best guess is that all you out there who are getting MAPS with lets say... shady credentials, might find themselves getting a stripped down version in the near future or none at all. They are in the process of adding a 4th tier of partners. This 4th tier will be required to complete 1 or 2 Microsoft exams, have a current subscription to MAPS and a few other requirements. This seems to be a two fold decision to weed out the non-legit MAPS users and to separate the registered partners into a more suitable category.  Not sure how long until this takes effect but from what I'm told, it would be just a matter of months. So, enjoy those MAPS subscriptions while you can guys.
