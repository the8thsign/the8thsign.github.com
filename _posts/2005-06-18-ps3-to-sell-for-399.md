While still awhile away for the next-gen console releases, more and more details are coming out each day. Today is the rumored $399 price tag for the PS3. While its not a huge surprise, it is a little disappointing.  With the xbox360 rumored to be $299 and the Revolution to be even cheaper($199?,$249? maybe?) its going to be the first time consoles are going to go head to head on features and hype. All this sounds strangely familiar from 10 years ago.  Sega was a dominate force in console hardware at the time and had just released the Sega Saturn. While it sold good in Japan, US has a lukewarm response for a few reasons but one main one was the $399 price tag it carried. Months later Playstation was released by newcomer Sony at $299. Pretty much the rest is history. Sony is now the #1 console manufacture and Sega is out of the hardware market.  Will history repeat itself? Guess we'll know in less than a year.

With this all said, this upcoming battle of console is still light years ahead of what was happening 10 years ago.  Alot of people, including myself, believe that the xbox360 is being rushed. I believe the original xbox still has plenty of life left in it. Also the lack of a next-gen optical reader, which brings up another point. Yesterday in an interview, Billy Gates mentioned something about a HD-DVD drive being in the Xbox360 at some point but the initial batches will have just a DVD ROM inside. Does this mean that I will need to rebuy an Xbox360 if I want HD-DVD? Also Microsoft's E3 showing was a little weak considering the Xbox360 will be in people�s homes in less than 5months.  Dev kits were still Alpha, the lack of Perfect Dark Zero, no Halo 3 news, no "system seller" launch title. If you listened to the MS keynote at E3, it was all about Xbox Live which is there strong point at the moment. With the success of XBL, you had to see it coming that the Xbox360 was going to be designed around it. While i see this as a good move on MS part, I really wasn�t feeling all nickel and dimming going on with the Marketplace, Premium Content, and different XBL levels. I don�t know about you but I'm not dropping $300 just to buy T-shirts from VelocityGirl, i want to play video games, not shop Cafepress!
