So i drove up to Westover Air Force base in Mass. today to take my ASVAB test. Scored an 83. Not too too bad for being out of school for 10 years. Funny part was i had no clue how to divide anymore lol. I'm going to look at what jobs are available to me sometime this week or next. I need to goto the Doctors office so i can have my toe looked at first tho. They said it would be like $150 for a consultation and X-ray which i think i can swing. Was talking to the recruiter today about what the army pays and i really don't think i can swing it. They give $1100 for the 5 months I'm in training which just isn't enough to cover my expenses. I'd come home to having my car repo'd or being evicted. Cant have that. Guess the other option is to wait until the end of the year when my lease is up and go into the Army full time. Not sure what to do at this point.
