Last night I want to one of the Potter Parties at B&amp;N. Was absolute madness. I got there about 11:30pm and i had to park like 3 parking lots away. You couldn't even move in the place. They had to ask people to move outside because they were well overcapacity lol. I was number 278 and finally got my book at 12:54am...but I cant read it yet as i have yet to finish OotP. I started reading it 2 years ago then i moved and it got kinda lost in the fray. I went to go read it one day and the entire book was covered in mold because I had a water leakage problem in my basement. *sigh* So i did pick up the 5 year set which includes years 1-5 since i gave all my other books away. Now I'm reading OoTP again so i can dive into HBP.
