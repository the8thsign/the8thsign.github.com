So i took the weekend off from the gym. I needed a break bad. I worked out hard on Friday plus I'm sunburned like no man atm from going to the beach. I guess thats what i get for having a CRT tan for years. I also went down to the Army recruiting office to look at some jobs. Top 3 for my ASVAB scores, which i scored an 83 and not an 81 btw, where:

Chemical Operations: which is basically chemical warfare stuff. eh but $10k bonus.

Practical Nurse: this I wouldn't mind, but i'm kinda squeamish around that kinda stuff plus its 68weeks training, 68weeks!

Intelligence: this was something i wanted too. Pays a $10k bonus, is stationed in Danbury which isn't too bad and its one of the better Company's in CT. Plus is its also an airborne unit, so means i would get to jump out of planes, weeeeee.
