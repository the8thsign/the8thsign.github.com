Just got back from the casting call for Attack of the Show! in NYC. Call was from 1-5pm, so i hopped the 12:00pm train into GCT and got there about 1:40pm. Decided to walk down to W 29th St since it wasn't too bad of a walk. Got down there at around 2:00pm and was pretty easy to find since the line was half way down the street. So i get in line and ask the guys in front of me where to get the paper work. Was told a casting director was passing it out. So I waited in line for almost 3hrs in the 95 degree heat. Bunch of us in line were just bullshitting about everything, game, G4, music etc. Was good times. Finally the line started moving quick and they were taking 10 people at a time by the end. I really think they had made up there mind before NYC because they didn't even seem to actually interview anyone. When i got up there, they had all 10 of line up, state our names and where we were front. Then asked us what kinda segment we would want for ourselves. That was it. Oh and they gave us the paper work to fill out when we got to the casting room. At that point i was so hungry, tired, hot and just wanted to get out of there, i didn't even try when filling out the paper work. One of the questions was "What makes you a nerd" and all i put was the names of the Icy Hot Stuntaz down. So ya, I'm not going to be the next co-host of AOTS but fuck ya i tried.
