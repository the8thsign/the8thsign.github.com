I learned how to play the intros to Scotty Doesnt Know and Dammit on the guitar last night. I'm so fuckin rawk. I've been using a Les Paul lately and while its an awesome guitar, the tone switch placement really fucks me up when playing. Just the way i hold a guitar, i ALWAYS hit it. SO instead of the Les Paul I'm probably just going to go with a straight up Strat again.
