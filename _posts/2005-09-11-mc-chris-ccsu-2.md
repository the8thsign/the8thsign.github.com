Went to see mc chris at CCSU last night. He tore shit up. MC Lars opened and was pretty good too. I'm going to have to check him out some more. I got a couple of shitty camera phone pics, oh well. But i did get to meet MC, he signed my CD which is fuckin rawk. So after the show, me and a friend headed down to the Savvory Fish or something to see Beetlejuice, the dude from Stern. So we get there and they want fuckin $20 cover. Bullshit. Called another friend who was waiting for us and told him fuck the $20 cover and come down to Danny O's for a drink with us. That didn't happen, he ended up going home after leaving. So i just kinda chilled the rest of the night. Ended up watching the rest of Season 1 of Entourage. Good shit, cant wait to start on Season 2.
