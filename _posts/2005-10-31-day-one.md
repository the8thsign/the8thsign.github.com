Starting my new lifehack, GTD lifestyle today. First area I'm going to work on is web browsing. I spent an inordinate amount of time just surfing. So today i deleted all my bookmarks and installed Foxylicious and Bloglines. Going to use Del.icio.us for my bookmarks and bloglines to keep track of them using RSS. This way I don't have to sit and keep a vigil over everything so i don't miss anything. Had to uninstall Firefox 1.5b2 and go back to 1.0.7 just to get half the extensions and scripts to work again. No big deal, 1.5 didn't add anything i cant live without.
