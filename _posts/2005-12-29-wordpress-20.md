Upgraded to the new Wordpress 2.0 late last night. Upgrade went pretty smoothly with no problems. Most new stuff looks to be under the hood but new admin console is nice as is the new "Write Post" editor. Noticed a few little AJAX additions that look to be a nice time saver. Took the time to remove the "Skype Me" button as i don't have Skype installed atm. I may add it back in if i ever start using Skype again. Added a "My Diggs" sidebar section which displays what I've been digging on <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-admin/http//www.digg.com">Digg.com</a>. Last i changed from the <a href="http://www.tedpearson.com/blog/?page_id=778">WP-Scrobbler</a> plug in to <a href="http://leflo.de/projekte/scrobbler/">Scrobbler</a>. Was getting tired of the section being blank when i had nothing in my Recently Played on <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>. Scrobbler handles it a little nicer by adding a "Not Listening" when my list is empty.
