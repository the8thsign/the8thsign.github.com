Just wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year. 2006 looks to be a great year, HD looks to be taking off with LCD HDTVs prices dropping faster than Paris Hilton in a homemade video. Xbox360 (finally on shelves), Playstation 3 and Revolution all dropping this year, should make it exciting in the gaming community. Hope PSP finally gets some "killer app" games as mine has been just sitting collecting dust. I have no use for $20 UMD movies. I really have no idea why UMD movies are so popular, why on earth would anyone want to watch a full length film on a screen that small is beyond me. I don't think they are a bad idea, I'm just dumbfounded as to why they are more popular than games on the PSP. I have a couple of goals this year, first being to buy my first Mac, the plan is to pick up a Intel MacMini when they get released. I want to completely switch over to Mac for my desktop. Tho this might not happen because Windows Vista will be out this year and I'm going to definitely be all over that. I've really been trying to make MCE work in my home and want to see what they do in Vista MCE. Its not quite there yet in MCE 2005 for me, but I'm hoping with Vista and xbox360 it will finally be what Ive been looking for.
