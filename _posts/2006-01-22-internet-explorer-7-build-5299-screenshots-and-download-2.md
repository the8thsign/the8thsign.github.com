The folks over at JCXP.net have screenshots and a download of a recent IE7 build.

Had a chance to install and play around with this a little. Definitely a huge improvement over the beta1 i had installed. UI is refined and usable. You can see a lot of Vista in the UI already. New Setting screen, RSS feeds are more usable tho i do not like the way Microsoft took RSS feeds in IE 7. I prefer the Firefox LiveBookmarks method. In IE7, basically you bookmark the feeds XML file and it formats it into a pretty CSS view ala Sage. While the eye candy is here, rendering is completely hosed in this build. Pages like Digg, Slashdot and Meebo are completely useless as they cant be rendered correctly. I realize this will all be fixed  but it makes this build useless for daily use. Its nice to see what changes they have made to IE but this is definitely a install for a day or two then uninstall.
