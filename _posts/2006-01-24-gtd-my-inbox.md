While looking over 43folders.com's RSS feed, i came across this <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz/">article</a> about cleaning up your inbox. While i never thought i had "email overload", i did have 2300 emails in my inbox and would miss some. My problem is i use Outlook and Exchange, so i get emails in Outlook, on my MPx220 and using Outlook Web Access if I'm not at my computer. So emails tend to slip through the cracks. Decided to make my inbox my next GTD project this year. Moved everything out into a DMZ folder, then sorted by sender. This way i could clean up emails i know i didnt need. Ended up deleting 591 in about 15mins, plus my inbox is empty so no where to do but downhill from here.
