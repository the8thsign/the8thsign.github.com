Most Lost theories, and there are many, are total crap, but this is by far the best and most thought out one I've seen so far.

Picked this up on digg today. Really good theory that i would like to see be right for a change. The whole �collective conscious� theory gives everything a so much deeper meaning. I remember when i was watching Serial Experiments Lain and they were touching on a lot of cyberpunk themes. There was something called �the Wired� which not unlike our Internet, connected people together. The difference was it used Carl Yung's �collective unconscious� theory. The Wired was connecting everyone using Schumann resonance. Electromagnetism using a very low frequency, somewhere between 5-10Hz. So instead of wires and input devices to connect us, i.e. the internet, the Wired connected everyone using there minds all running at this low frequency.  Most people will see the similarities to the Matrix. Some really good food for thought stuff here. I really enjoyed Lain and am a little bit more excited to see if Lost is using this kinda background as a plot basis. I do think i will break out the Lain DVDs this weekend and watch them again as my interest is now piqued again.
