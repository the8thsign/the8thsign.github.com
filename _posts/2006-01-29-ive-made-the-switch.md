One of my goals this year was to switch from Windows XP to Mac OS X. With Apple switching over to Intel, and the introduction of the Mac Mini, it was the perfect time. When Apple announced last year that they were switching to Intel, my thoughts were that the Mac Mini would be the first to get the Intel treatment. Well, January rolled around and Apple announced new Intel based Macs but no Mini. Foiled. Since i was feeling the itch, i decided to scratch it. I got my hands on 10.4.3 DVD and patched it with JaS 1111a Generic Patch v4.2b. Since I didn't know what to expect, I wanted to test out OS X first to be sure i could use it on a daily basis. So i installed another hard drive into my PC and disconnected the Windows hard drive. This way i would be forced to use OS X to do what i need without just switching to XP and getting it done. The install worked for the most part except a few small things which were due to unsupported hardware, mainly video drivers as i had a Nvidia card. I've used this setup for about a week now and i am hooked. I can do everything i do on a daily basis and do it better and easier. It is now time to build a dedicated box for OS X supports with full hardware support and make the switch permanent.
