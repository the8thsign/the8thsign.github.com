Just a couple changes to the site. Updated to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/01/201-release/">Wordpress 2.0.1</a>. Mostly bug-fixes but fixed an important one involving ecto and file uploading. Also switch to the OS X version of <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto 2.4.1</a>. I like how the OS X version deals with <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> so i went back and redid all my Technorati Tags for all my posts.
