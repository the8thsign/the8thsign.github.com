Finally got around to installing Wordpress 2.0.2. Nothing big, mostly a security release with a few bug-fixes mixed it. One exciting thing I've been watching over at wordpress.org is <a href="http://widgets.wordpress.com/">Widgets</a>. Basically is a plugin engine that allows drag and drop reordering of your sidebar. If testing goes well, it may be included with the next release of WP. Only downside is that themes need to be updated in order to work with it.

Last week I got an invitation code for <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> after what seemed like months of waiting. I've been using <a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing Metrics</a> for a few weeks already and have decided to use both for a bit to see which reporting I prefer. Honestly, I've been liking Performancing Metrics better. Google Analytics seems to be more geared towards goals and marketing. I've got them both running on the site now and will continue to evaluate them.
