Watched V for Vendetta over the weekend. Wow, favorite movie this year so far. Its about time an Allan Moore work has been done some justice after the disgrace of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the uneventful From Hell. DC has been on fire lately with last year's Batman Begins and now V for Vendetta. If you could get past the fact Ted �Theodore� Logan played John Constantine, Constantine wasn't too bad either. Then again I'm a sucker for Heaven vs Hell stuff. If this is any taste of whats to come, Superman Returns is going to be great.

Now Marvel should have a blockbuster with both the upcoming X-men 3 and next year's Spider-man 3. I just wish Marvel would put as much work into their lesser films as they would with X-men and Spider-man. Hulk, Fantastic Four, Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra. All ok but nothing great.

The difference between the DC films and Marvel films is that DC seems to make movies from good stories where Marvel tries to ride popularity of the titles. While I do like Spider-man and X-men, so far my favorite comic book movies are Sin City and V for Vendetta, both lesser know comics but great works. Now with the right writer and director, a popular title can and will make a great movie also. Spider-man, X-men and Batman Begins fall into this category. So I don't see why Marvel can't stop rushing out films just to get them out and rather take there time with each franchise. Comic book movies can generate a lot of money for the company if done right. Sequels are pretty much a given. I'll tell you right now I'll see X-men 3 opening night but I wouldn't even give Elektra 2 a second thought.
