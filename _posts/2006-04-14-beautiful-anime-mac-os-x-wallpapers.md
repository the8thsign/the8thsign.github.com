While surfing around this morning for a new wallpaper I ran across <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/m_hiroshi/index.html">M's Desktop Pictures</a>. Beautiful Anime wallpapers with different Apple logos and products. Definitely stop by take a look and add alittle sex appeal to your desktop. Most wallpapers include a widescreen version too.

If you're like me and can't figure out which one you like the best, try this. Download all the wallpapers into a folder, then under Desktop and Screensaver, choose the folder and set �<em>Change picture every X minutes</em>� and check �<em>Random Order</em>�.

Enjoy.
