<a href="http://www.hornware.com/sharepoints/">SharePoints</a>, a great little app for Mac OS X was finally made universal today with the release of version 3.5.4. <a href="http://www.hornware.com/sharepoints/">SharePoints</a> allows you to easily make shares from any folder, and change properties with ease.ï¿½ Supports both SMB and AFS and can be run as an app or a Preference Pane. I find it a great way to set up SMB shares for <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com">Xbox Media Center</a> without having to either share your entire home folder or mess with the smb.conf file. The program is donation-ware so if you find this useful, please consider making a donation to the author.
