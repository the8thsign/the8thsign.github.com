While rummaging through some files tonight i came across some old webpages of mine. Found some old personal pages, some stuff from work, incomplete sites i had started and even some old school linux pages, not sites, pages from as far back as 1998. While most are too embarrassing to show you, i thought I'd share two with you. One is my first �blog� before i even knew what a blog was and another is a Mac theme i made for Windows 98 when the original iMac's were released.

Some links may still work while others are long gone. You're milage may vary
