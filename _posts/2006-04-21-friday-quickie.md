Since I had to send back my motherboard for RMA and I probably wont get it back til next month, I probably won't be posting much. So in the mean time, short multi-topic posts are my friend.

Based on an <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/19/jimi-wallet/">article</a> on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43folders.com</a> the other day, I picked up a <a href="http://thejimi.com/wallet/index.php">Jimi Wallet</a> myself today. I have some Before and After pics up on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/">Flickr</a>. I'm liking it so far, tho I'm always checking to see if I have my wallet with me
now.

Been listening to the new <a href="http://www.takingbacksunday.com/">Taking Back Sunday</a>. I was really looking forward to it and i wouldn't go as far as saying I'm disappointed but Taking Back Sunday - John Nolan + Major Label = not good. Song writing has taken a turn, even there song titles are now actually lyrics in the songs. �MakeDamnSure� is a great song, lot of TAYF in there. Only other song I'm feeling is �I'll Let You Live�. But, its only been day one so maybe it will grow one me, who knows.

<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/google-calendar-greasemonkey-todo-list-addon.html">Google Calender Greasemonkey ToDo List</a> - Nice addon til something official comes from <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> themselves.

Officially switching from a Motorola MPx220 and Exchange to a Motorola RAZR and <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Google Mail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a>. I'll post alot more on that later.
