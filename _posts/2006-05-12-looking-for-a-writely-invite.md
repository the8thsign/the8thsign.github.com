Well after about 3 weeks I finally got my new motherboard so i can get back to blogging (i have a list of stuff). But in the last 3 weeks I've picked up a night job so time management has been alittle hard. If anyone has a <a href="http://www.writely.com">Writely</a> invite they could shoot my way via jadedhalo at gmail dot com I'd appreciate it. My plan is to be write down alot of my thoughts in <a href="http://www.writely.com">Writely</a> while at work then move them over into ecto when i get time.

UPDATE: Shoutout to Elling over at <a href="http://lifeofelling.blogspot.com/">Life of Elling</a> for a <a href="http://www.writely.com">Writely</a> invite.
