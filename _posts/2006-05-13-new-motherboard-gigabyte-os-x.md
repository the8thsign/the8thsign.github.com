After finally getting fed up enough with the flickering cause by my old motherboard (onboard video), I decided to RMA it. Was told it would be 5-7 days, so sent in my old board to get replaced. Well a week later, thanks to UPS Ground and it going to coast to coast, I see a credit for the motherboard on my bank statement. So i call newegg and they inform me that the board is discontinued so they refund me. That would be all fine and dandy except this board was used to run Mac OS X so its not exactly like i could pick up any old board. It needed to have very specific hardware on it. The Foxconn was perfect. After searching online for hours to find one last Foxconn board i gave up and starting looking into alternatives. Let me tell you, it was hard finding a Intel 915 chipset using DDR and compatible Sound and LAN with video onboard. Only one i found was the Gigabyte GA-8I915ME-GL, on eBay none the less, but for a good price. $29. For that price it was worth a shot. So i used Buy it Now! and waited.

Got the board in almost 3 weeks to the day i sent the old one back and installed it as fast as i could. I missed OS X. I was using an old laptop of mine with XP on it and another with Vista on it while i was down. I couldn't wait to get OS X back. Installed the board, booted up and everything looked good expect some permission errors which where quickly fixed by running a Repair Permissions.

The new GA-8i915ME-GL fixed some annoying problems i had with the Foxconn which i an extremely pleased with. One being i had to use the Line Out instead of the Speaker Out on the old board. Also, the front Mic and Speaker Out work now too which they didn't before. Only small problem I've run into is when i plug in my headphones to the front jack, it doesn't complete cut off the speaker output. It doesn't lower the volume tho. I can live with that seeing as i couldn't even use headphones nor a mic before.

So all in all this seems like a great starting board if you want to build your own Hackintosh. Its just too bad i didnt start with this board instead of the Foxconn.
