Just received an email from Skype stating that all call within the US are now free. This includes to all landline and cell phones. This is AWESOME considering they just released a Universal binary for OS X last week. Only downside to this is that its only good for the rest of the year. Its still a good solid 6 months. I've been toying with the idea of switching to Skype for my landline for a new months now and now this plus the universal binary for OS X has pretty much made my decision. Next I need to look at Skype compatible phones and make the switch.
