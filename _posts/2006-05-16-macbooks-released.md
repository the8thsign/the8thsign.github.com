Apple released there iBook replacement, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">MacBook</a>, today as if you haven't already seen it already. I've been waiting for these to be released as I've decided that as long as the MacBook had the same specs as a Mac Mini, I was going to buy one. Well, they one-up'd me and including a 2.0GHz Core Duo and built-in iSight. Don't like the 60G HDD tho as i have 40G of music but I'll figure something out. My plan is to pick up the $1299 model this weekend, we'll see tho. At $1299 I'm probably going to goto an Apple Store and check them out compared to the 17ï¿½ iMac. Its a toss up at this point.
