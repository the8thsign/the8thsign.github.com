Went into the city today to check out the opening of the new Apple Store and to pick up a Macbook. Boy was that a mistake. Got there about 6:30pm and OMG was the line long. I've never seen anything like it before in my line. Its stretched almost 9 blocks. No way I was standing in line that long. So went down to Time Square, grabbed a bite to eat then headed home. I'm going to just goto the local Apple store here and pick up my Macbook tomorrow. Apple Store NYC is just going to have to wait another day.
