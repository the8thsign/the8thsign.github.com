The switch is complete. On Saturday, I bought my first computer and it was a Apple Macbook. Now, I've owned computers before, alot of them as a matter of fact, but this is the first one I have ever purchased. In the past I've build all my PC, even built a PC just to run OS X. The fact is I probably wouldn't be a Mac user today if OS X wasn't cracked and distributed online.

Now for the goodies. I got the 2.0GHz Macbook in white with stock memory and hard drive. I've already ordered 2GB RAM for this and in a week or two I will order a 120GB Hard Drive to swap out. As is tho, this thing screams. Easily the best computer i've ever owned. I was alittle but off in the store by the 13.1" screen but after using it I have to say the screen is absolutely brilliant, i love the glossy screen. The keyboard took about a day to get use to now I'm using it like a pro. The touchpad is great, can scroll pages and right click, and it works far better than i expected. I was assuming i would have to connect a mouse to it but there is no need with the new trackpad. So far I'm in love. I'm still in the process of setting it up and reinstalling apps and really wont be able to give it a run for its money til i get the upgraded RAM and HDD.
