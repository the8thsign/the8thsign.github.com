Seen over at <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/Apple%20and%20Nike%20launch%20$29%20Nike+iPod%20Sport%20Kit">Engadget</a>, among other places, that Nike is releasing a new line of shoes called Nike+ and a Pedometer that interfaces with your iPod. Big deal right? Well, this is what it does also:
<ul>
	<li>Voice prompts to let you know your status without always looking down at your iPod</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Center button makes use of your "power" song. That one song that gets you really moving went you need it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Its social. Your data is synced in iTunes and sent to a server so you can  chart your progress and look at others.</li>
</ul>
The Sports kit is $29, which is very reasonable but Nike+ sneakers are $80~. I'm in the market for new running shoes anyways so this doesnt bother me as much as others. I already have an iPod Nano so thats covered. So basically, I'm sold. I do alot of running at the gym and this will be a nice motivated. Nothing gets me motivated like gadgets and social networking. First shoes are available June 1, and I'll be picking up the Air Max Moto+ next week.
