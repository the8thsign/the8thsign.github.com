While poking around <strong>flickr</strong> i came across these screenshots of a beta release of <strong>Windows Live Mail Desktop</strong>. I'm not sure what <strong>Microsoft's</strong> plan is here because this is different from <strong>Microsoft Mail</strong> that comes with <strong>Vista</strong>. He has a few more pics up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/picturepan2">here</a>. Now, I'm about one of the most tech savvy people out there but seriously, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is really confusing the shit out of me with <strong>Live</strong> and <strong>Vista</strong>.
