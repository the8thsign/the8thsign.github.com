Kevin over at <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/">theory.isthereason</a> is hosting a meme contest called <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=1001">BestBlogForward</a> to celebrate his 1000th post. I have contacted Kevin about sponsoring the contest and will be giving away a Flickr Pro account. Over the weekend I will go through my posts and stats and post my BestBlogForward also. Here are the instructions, Its pretty simple.
<blockquote><strong><em>THE INSTRUCTIONS</em></strong>

<strong><em>1. Find the most popular post on your blog</em></strong><em>
You can discover this either by checking your web statistics service, most number of comments, or simply googling yourself and finding what tops the rankings. Suggestions on using blog trackers like </em><em><a href="http://www.blogpulse.com/profile?type=citations&amp;url=http://theory.isthereason.com">BlogPulse</a></em><em> and </em><em><a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/">Technorati</a></em><em> are welcomed. If all this sounds too complicated, just go wth your instinct!</em>

<strong><em>2. Blog the story behind it!</em></strong><em>
Blog the story behind your most popular post by giving the permalink, what its about, how it became popular and how you came to write about it. Its a great way to see our different blogging strategies. I'll post mine as an example soon but get started if you get the picture.</em>

<strong><em>3. Tag "BestBlogForward"</em></strong><em>
Once you're done writing, make sure to title and tag it "BestBlogForward". Link your post back </em><em><a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=1001">here</a></em><em> if you wish to qualify for the contest. Everyone will also be able to see your post over at </em><em><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bestblogforward">Technorati</a></em><em> if you use the following HTML code: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bestblogforward" rel="tag"&gt;bestblogforward&lt;/a&gt;</em>

<strong><em>THE DEADLINE</em></strong><em>
THIS CONTEST ENDS AT 11.59PM ON MEMORIAL DAY, MAY 29th 2006. After that, you can continue adding to the meme, but you won't be getting a prize (it's self-gratifying already right?). ';ll pick out the most interesting blog story and announce the winner next week.</em>

<strong><em>THE PRIZE</em></strong><em>
Since I'm not exactly rich, I'm emailing the winner a $25 Amazon gift certificate. If I find more than 50 individual submissions, I'll try to give a Flickr Pro account or an iTunes gift certificate to the runner-up. I'm currently approaching some Web 2.0 sponsors for more prizes in case this gets widespread. If anyone's interested to sponsor, let me know and I'll plug you. I'll have the final say as to how things go, but rest assured, I'm hoping to make this experience as enjoyable as possible.</em>

<strong><em>THE FAVOR</em></strong><em>
Before you go, help me pass the word about this meme contest by telling your friends, by submitting it to your favorite social-bookmarking service (e.g. </em><em><a href="http://www.digg.com/links/Put_your_%E2%80%9CBestBlogForward%E2%80%9D_meme_contest">Digg</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a></em><em>) or simply adding me to your blogroll. If you haven't done so, you can </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/THEORYISTHEREASON">subscribe to my blog's RSS feed here</a></em><em>.
