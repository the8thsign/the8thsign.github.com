Not exactly sure if this is my most popular post but its my most popular since I've installed analytics software. My 105th was basically a list of software I was using in OS X to do my everyday computing after I switched. It was only about a week of using OS X when i created the list hoping others might benefit from my cold turkey switch.

When 2006 started, I had made a small list of things I wanted to do. Not so much of New Years resolutions, but more like geek resolutions. Things i wanted to accomplish on the tech side of my life. One of them was to switch to Mac OS X as my primary desktop. About the only thing that had stopped me was the price of Mac's. I've built my own PC's since day one and have also bought part by part. Much easier to swallow. In January, I got the chance to install a leaked version of OS X for intel hardware. I was immediately hooked. But i wanted to be sure it just wasn't geek envy. So I did what I always do when trying to learn something new. Jump in head first. I installed OS X on a new hard drive and took out my old Win XP drive. This way i had to use OS X for everything I wanted to do. I spend the next 10 days pretty much downloading every piece of software on Macupdate and Versiontracker. At first I was simply trying to replicate my Windows setup program for program. My post then clearly shows this. As of today I've had about 6 months to find out what works and what doesn't for my everyday computing. I'd say only about 50% of that list is still what I use today and honestly, in another 6 months, everything may change again.

One of the reasons I think i get so much traffic is because there are a lot of new "switchers" out there just like me. The first thing most people do is install their favorite software. When you don't know what your favorite software is anymore, you go looking. I know I did and I found a lot of sites and people who give me some great recommendations.
