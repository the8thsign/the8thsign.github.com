Batwoman will return to DC Comics as a "lipstick lesbian" in 52. The new-look Batwoman is just one of a wave of ethnically and sexually diverse characters entering the DC Comics universe.

This is going to pretty interesting to watch. Beautiful woman in black latex kicking ass then goes to kiss girls after? What comic nerd doesn't want to see that! I guess DC is playing it safe by bringing back a character that has been pretty much dormant for 50 years to test the waters. I've been picking up the 52 comics just haven't started reading them yet. Looks like I'll have a reason to start now.
