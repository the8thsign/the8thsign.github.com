The news late on May 30th was that stores were selling DS Lites ahead of its release date, 11 days early. Most people were having luck at Walmart and Target stores but I've seen reports saying they have found them in Sears also. So 8am the next morning I rushed out to hit all the Walmart's and Target's in my area fast and furious.  After about two hours of driving and checking, I went home empty handed. Oh well. Looks like I'll be waiting til June 11th but I am definitely picking a DS Lite and Mario (maybe even Brain Age too) that day. Atleast <a href="http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/2006/05/31/new-ds-lite/">Jon</a> and <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/05/31/My-Nintendo-DS-Lite.aspx">Major Nelson</a> got lucky and scored one.
