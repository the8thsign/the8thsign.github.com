No more than 24 hours after getting my brand new <strong>Macbook</strong> was I reinstalling <strong>Mac OS X</strong> from the restore CDs. For this feat I can take no credit. That credit goes to <a href="http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/">Monolingual</a>. What seemed like a novel idea, to save some precious hard drive space by deleting unused language files, turned out to be a "How to reinstall Mac OS X" lesson.

For some reason, <strong>Monolingual</strong> strips out <strong>PPC</strong> binary code on Intel Mac's, by default no less. This totally kills <strong>Rosetta</strong>. Not cool. No where in the <strong>FAQ</strong> or <strong>documentation</strong> does it say to not run this with those options turned on for <strong>Intel</strong> Mac's.  To be fair, <strong>Monolingual</strong> did save me space but only because I unchecked the extra language files and programs when i was running the restore.
