A few months ago I seen a bunch of post about <strong>Valleyschwag</strong> and was pretty interested. Jello of the month club for geeks. I signed up but almost immediately canceled as i was moving and looking for a new job at the time so didnt want spend anything i didn't have too.

Well, <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/">Kevin</a> got his 2nd <a href="http://www.valleyschwag.com">Valleyschwag</a> shipment <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=1005">over the weekend</a> and I got all excited again and signed up again. I should be able to get in on the June shipment which looks like it should be a good one. I'll keep the service for 2-3 months and see how it turns out. I read about a lot of people who weren't really happy with their May shipment. I guess that could be a problem when jumping from 60 to 1500 customers. For $15/month, if I get atleast one T-shirt and some small stuff, it might be worth it.
