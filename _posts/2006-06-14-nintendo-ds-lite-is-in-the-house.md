On Sunday i took a ride down to my local <strong>Gamestop</strong> and traded in my <strong>Sony PSP</strong> with a few games and accessories and picked up a <strong>Nintendo DS Lite</strong>. I bought my <strong>PSP</strong> at launch and outside of the first month or so, its been sitting collecting dust. Nice system, just i have no interest in movies for it and there hasn't been one game I've even remotely been interested in since launch. Thought it was time for my <strong>PSP</strong> to do me some good finally . It fully paid for my <strong>DS Lite</strong> on a trade it, which i was happy about.

I picked up a bunch of games:
<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li>New Super Mario Brothers</li>
	<li>Brain Age</li>
	<li>Nintendogs</li>
	<li>Mario Kart DS</li>
	<li>Burnout Legends</li>
	<li>Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</li>
	<li>Animal Crossings: Wild World</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy IV (GBA)</li>
</ul>
I also pre-ordered <strong>Final Fantasy III</strong>. I really wanted the <strong>Castlevania</strong> game but it was no where to be found in 4 different stores. Talking to one of the guys at <strong>Gamestop</strong>, I guess its hard to find, so I'll hit up <strong>eBay</strong> for a copy.

<strong>NSMB</strong> and <strong>Brain Age</strong> are my current favorites.  Played <strong>Mario Kart</strong> online and was fun but haven't really played much since. Haven't touched <strong>Nintendogs</strong> or <strong>Animal Crossings</strong> yet and <strong>Burnout</strong> and <strong>RE:DS </strong>are pretty disappointing. I'll be trading those in for <strong>Meteos</strong> I think as I have heard good stuff about that game.

As for the system itself, well I never had a DS so its hard to compare the two but I'm loving the DS Lite so far. Its small, light, the screen is brilliant and the <strong>Polar White</strong> matches my <strong>Macbook</strong> and <strong>iPod Nano</strong> perfectly. And the icing of the cake is there are lot of games coming out I'm interested in, which is a lot to say about any system.
