On Tuesday, i logged into my Final Fantasy XI account for the last time. After almost 4 years, i canceled my account. While I havent really played in well over a year, I still had a few friends that did. At final count, 160 days of my life was eaten in Van'adiel. With all the ups and downs, my first MMO is offically behind me.
