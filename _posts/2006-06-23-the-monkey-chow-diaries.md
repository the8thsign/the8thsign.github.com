Meet Adam Scott. A few weeks ago he decided he was fed up with shopping, cooking and cleaning so decided to try and live off monkey chow for seven days. During the 7 days, he keep a blog of stats and made a video blog of the whole ordeal. Head over to <a href="http://www.angryman.ca/monkey.html">The Monkey Chow Diaries</a> to see how he made out. I just wish we would have went 30 days, that would have equally interesting and entertaining.

Monkey Chow Out.
