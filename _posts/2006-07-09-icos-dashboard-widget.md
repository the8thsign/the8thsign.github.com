<a href="http://www.icomicsonsale.com/lib/download.php"><img src="http://www.icomicsonsale.com/images/Icon.png" border="0" height="82" width="82" /></a> The <a href="http://www.icomicsonsale.com/lib/download.php">iCOS Dashboard Widget,</a> short for <a href="http://www.icomicsonsale.com/">IComicsOnSale</a>, allows you to browse and search which <strong>comic books</strong> are being released that week. It pulls it data from <a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/shipping.asp" target="_blank">Diamond Comics Shipping List</a> and features an <strong>iTunes</strong>-like interface which allows you to browse by the major publishers or by the type of media being released. Interface sports a <strong>search</strong> at the top to easily find titles and it supports <strong>smart lists</strong>, similar to smart playlists but no where near as powerful. Think of them as saved title searchs. If you like <strong>Superman</strong>, you can make a smart list with Superman and it will show you ever title that has Superman being release that week. Great for keep taps on your favorite comics. I've been looking for an <strong>widget</strong> like this for ages.
