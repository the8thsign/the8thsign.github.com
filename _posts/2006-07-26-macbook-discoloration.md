Well, my Macbook got hit by the discoloration on the palm rests. While not as bad as the picture above, it was starting to be noticable. So before letting it get worst, I decided to get it taken care of ASAP. Made an appointment at a local Apple store's Genius Bar and even tho it was only slightly starting to show, they said they would replace the top under warranty. All they asked was if I smoked(I don't, if your wondering). 7 days was my turnaround time, which is along time to be with a computer, but now I'm back and better than ever.

2 days before I picked up my Macbook they offically acknoweledged the problem with <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304058">KB Article 304058</a>. I've since moved to using an <a href="http://static.zooomr.com/images/356b16be1aca1209fe7da4e746dc88f39d4edf72.jpg">iCurve and Apple KB/Mouse</a>.
