So this week was another onslaught of iPhone rumors mostly fueled by <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1888">entries found in the iPod Updater</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/29/wild-speculation-iphone-to-launch-in-august/">rumors of an August launch</a>. Let me be the first one in line to buy this thing. Give me a flipphone that syncs over Bluetooth with iCal and Address Book plus 1gig memory to sync iTunes and I'm sold. I dont care what provider nor the cost of the phone. Right now I'm using a Motorola RAZR and frankly it sucks. Its only saving grace is its size. While I doubt it will happen, if it does drop, I'll be the first one in line.
