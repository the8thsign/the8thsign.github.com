Here is how to tweak Flock's My News to allow the sidebar to stay open and bypass the Front Page.
<ol>
	<li>type "<strong>about:config</strong>" in the Address bar</li>
	<li>in the Filter box, search for "<strong>flock.feeds.sidebar_tab_interaction</strong>"</li>
	<li>double click on it and it changes from <strong>TRUE</strong> to <strong>FALSE</strong></li>
</ol>
Now you will be able to open My News as a sidebar in the current tab and
not automatically load the Front Page. You will be able to pick what
feed or group you want to view from the sidebar, and it
will load in the current tab. Now if they just change it so links clicked on from My News would load in a new Window or Tab instead of the current window, I'd be all set.
