The September Issue of EGM (issue 207) is <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3152635">reporting</a> that Konami's <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></strong> is <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/03/symphony-of-the-night-to-be-heard-on-xbla/">headed</a> to <strong>Xbox Live Arcade</strong> sometime Q1 of 2007. From what it looks like, it will be a port of the <strong>PlayStation</strong> version and not the <strong>Sega Saturn</strong> version. Oh well.

If this is true, this is a system seller for me. Castlevania is my all time favorite series and SOTN is up there next to Rondo of Blood as best game of the series. With titles like <strong><a href="http://previews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1417/Galaga/p1/">Galaga</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/s/streetfighter2livearcadexbox360/default.htm">Street Fighter II</a></strong> for XBLA already, I'm one good title away from going out and buying a Xbox360. Lets just hope that game is <strong><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/20/rumor-guitar-hero-ii-on-xbox-360/">Guitar Hero II.</a></strong>
