Six Apart, the makers of <span>Typepad</span>, <span>Moveable</span> Type and <span>Livejournal</span> have recently launched <span>Vox</span>. While <span>Vox</span> i just another blogging system, if <span>tries</span> to combine web2.0 with social blogging. Kinda like a <span>Myspace</span>+<span>Livejournal</span> for the web2.0 crowd. You can view my site at <a href="http://jadedhalo.vox.com/">http://jadedhalo.vox.com</a>.ï¿½ It will probably get lost in the shuffle of the countless other blog accounts i have and <span>don't</span> use but maybe this one will be different. I have been thinking about keeping a personal blog again and I really like where <span>Vox</span> is going.

Right now <span>Vox</span> isn't open to the public but I have two invites I'm willing to give out. If you want an invite, leave a comment and I'll send out the invites randomly. Don't forget to add me to your <span>Neighborhood</span>.
