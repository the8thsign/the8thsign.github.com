VMware just announced their rumored VMware for Mac OS X this morning. You can shoot over to there <a href="http://www.vmware.com">webpage</a> to <a href="http://vmware.rsc02.net/servlet/campaignrespondent?_ID_=vmwi.1756">sign up</a> for the beta. Product is not available yet but signing up will get you the beta as soon as its available while the final product looks to be released before the end of the year.

I'm a <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">Parallel's</a> user myself and alittle excited to see what VMware is going to bring to the table. VMware is a more mature product with features like non-persistant disk mode and multiple freeze states which Parallel's does not have. I've used VMware for years on both Windows and Linux and will probably switch to VMware for OS X just for the simple fact of being able to open images on any system.
