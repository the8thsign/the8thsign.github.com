Hot on the heels of yesterdays <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/08/09/phoenix-wright-now-shipping/">news</a> of Phoenix Wright shipping from Amazon, Gamestop is <strong><a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product_id=180064">now shipping</a> </strong>Trauma Center. I called most local Gamestop/EB stores today and none had them instock, so looks like web only at the moment.
