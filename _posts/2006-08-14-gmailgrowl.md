Found a nifty little plugin for Gmail Notifier that adds Growl notifications when you receive email. Its probably only a matter of time before Gmail Notifier supports it natively but in the mean time, head over to Gmail+Growl's <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/gmailgrowl">homepage</a> and download the free plug in.
