At first, <a href="http://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a> just sounds like another open source DNS server daemon but thankfully its not. <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> is a <strong>free</strong> service that provides <strong>fast,</strong> <strong>secure</strong> DNS to anyone <strong>without</strong> installing any software. All you need to do is change your network setting to reflect OpenDNS's server instead of using your local ISP's servers.

<a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> cache is optimized so requests are super-fast. You can see an immediate increase in speed right off the bat. It also <strong>protects</strong> from Phishing sites by warning you when you view a know site. It can also <strong>corrects</strong> spelling mistakes, like www.craigslist.ogr, and redirect you to your intended site.

I switched a few days ago and I've noticed a big decrease in the time it takes webpages to show up. No more "Waiting for ...." messages in the status bar. Best part about <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> is that its <strong>free</strong> and there is <strong>no software</strong> to be installed. Give it a try, you got nothing to lose.
