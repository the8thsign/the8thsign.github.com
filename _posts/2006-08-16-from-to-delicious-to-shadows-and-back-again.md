Its no secret I'm in love with <strong>Flock</strong>. Right now, <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> supports two online bookmarking sites, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.shadows.com">Shadows</a>. I've been a del.icio.us for about a year and while its essential to me, the fact is del.icio.us doesn't have the flare of many newer web 2.0 sites. After finally getting curious enough to check out <strong>Shadows</strong>, I was liking what I was seeing.

First problem is how to get all my del.icio.us <strong>bookmarks</strong> into Shadows. Lo and behold that have a <a href="http://www.shadows.com/ImportTags/Default.rails">importer</a> just for del.icio.us. I've used <strong>importers</strong> on sites like <a href="http://www.blinklist.com">Blinklist</a> without a problem but not this time.  36 hours, 2 emails and 54 manual entries I finally had all my bookmarks over.  Now was time to switch in <strong>Flock</strong> which was the easiest part as its just goto Accounts and use Switch Services under Bookmarks. <strong>Painless</strong>. Did i mention how much I love Flock?

That was all about a week ago. Tonight I'm back to del.icio.us. Why? First and foremost, everything, EVERYTHING supports <strong>del.icio.us</strong>. Posting from RSS, <strong>wordpress</strong> widgets, <strong>firefox</strong> extensions, the list goes on and on. Second reason is all my <strong>friends</strong> are on del.icio.us and I like to keep up with what they are up too. Last reason is today, del.icio.us launched a <strong>redesign</strong>. While only affecting the homepage at the moment, it looks nicer with <strong>screenshots</strong> of sites like Shadows had and digg-like numbers to show how many people have saved it much like Blinklist.

So welcome back del.icio.us, you've been missed. Feel free to <strong>add me</strong> to your network to see what I'm bookmarking, my username is <a href="http://del.icio.us/jadedhalo">jadedhalo</a>.
