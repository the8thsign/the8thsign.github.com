Starting every Friday I will listing some of my favorite links, <strong><a href="http://www.digg.com/users/jadedhalo/dugg">diggs</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://del.icio.us/jadedhalo/">bookmarks</a></strong> from the week that I don't get to blog about. This week I'm going to start off with some links to  stuff I'm looking into buying for my <strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/198757913/">Macbook</a></strong>. Mostly cases since I'm in the market for a new one. My current <a href="http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=TSB315">Targus Backpack</a> has served me well over the years but now its just too big to lug around everywhere.
