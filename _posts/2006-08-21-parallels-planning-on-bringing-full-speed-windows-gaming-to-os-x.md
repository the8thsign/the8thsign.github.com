Over at the <a href="http://parallelsvirtualization.blogspot.com/">Parallels blog</a>, the guys touch on some post-WWDC news, notable on VMWare entering the market while Microsoft bows out. A few interesting bits come up for whats planned in upcoming versions of Parallels this year:
<ul>
	<li>A groundbreaking new user interface that will make running Windows on a Mac easier and more productive than ever before</li>
	<li>Never before seen security and management tools</li>
	<li>Capability to burn CDs and DVDs inside virtual machines</li>
	<li>Fast 3D graphics support via support for OpenGL and DirectX. You'll be able to run games at full speed without leaving your OS X desktop!</li>
	<li>An ACPI BIOS that provides the ability to run Microsoft Windows Vista</li>
</ul>
Wow. Parallels isn't pulling any punches here. New "groundbreaking" interface? Burn CDs inside a VM? FULL SPEED GAMING?! This stuff is HUGE for the Mac community. I know I said I would probably switch to VMWare in an earlier post, but I think the guys at Parallels now have a devoted customer in me.
