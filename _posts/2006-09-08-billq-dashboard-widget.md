I use <a href="http://www.mybillq.com/">billQ</a> to keep track of upcoming bills. Its a free service, web-based app that helps keep track  and manager your upcoming bills. It supports SMS reminders as well as iCal support so I can keep up with my bills. They just recently released a Dashboard Widget for OSX which I find to be extremely awesome as I don't have to visit the webpage anymore to see my upcoming bills and to mark them paid.
