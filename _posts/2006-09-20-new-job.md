Sorry about the lack of posts lately. Between starting a new job and my Macbook's case of RSD getting worse, I haven't had much time to blog. But trust me, I do have a list. I have tomorrow off so I might go on a blogging marathon. With my new job, I've started a blog about my new job. I'm not going to link to it nor let anyone know about it due to wanting it to be anonymous so I can blog freely.

Other than that, not much else going on. I do hope this post will be the beginning of some more personal posts for this blog. Somehows its lost that personal touch and I'm going to try to add that back in.
