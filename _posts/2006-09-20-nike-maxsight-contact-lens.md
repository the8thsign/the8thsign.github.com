Yup, <a href="http://www.nike.com/">Nike</a> has its own brand of contact lens call <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikevision/main.html#section=product&amp;subSection=product_maxsight">Nike MaxSight</a>. These are made by Bausch &amp; Lomb and target athletes.

* Provides distortion free optics
* Covers the entire pupil eliminating glare and enhancing contrast
* No frame or nosepiece obstructuon - no lens fogging or fit issues
* Blocks specific wavelengths of light - details appear clearer and �pop� off the background
* Filters out more than 90% of harmful blue light and 95% of UVA and UVB

They come in 2 colors, Amber and Grey-Green. Amber is geared toward sports like Soccer, Tennis, Baseball, Football and Rugby while the Grey-Green covers activities like Golf, Running and Training.

I'm looking to pick up some contacts soon and I might take a look at these. They offer a free trial and I have a lot of Retailers in my area.
