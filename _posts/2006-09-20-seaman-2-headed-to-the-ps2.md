Remember Seaman? Yup that Seaman, the one originally released for the Dreamcast. We'll he's back and in and not so much a "Sea"man this time around.  The basis is that a bones from a mini ape man were discovered and a company has cloned them to create mini ape man pets.

Thats about all the information that has been released. It will be on the PS2 and support voice communication with your seaman just like the original and a special PS2 controller sporting a built-in mic will be available when its released next year in Japan. No US release date yet.

I don't know about you but this type of game would be perfect for the Nintendo DS. Dual screens, built-in mic, stylist. A game like this could work very well on the DS.
