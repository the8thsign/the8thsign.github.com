While your drooling over the <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/09/20/oct-egm-confirms-24-of-40-tracks-for-upcoming-guitar-hero-ii/">newly confirmed songs</a> for Guitar Hero II, brush up on your Guitar Hero skills using one of these <a href="http://www.theguitarmania.com/servlet/Detail?no=1">Wireless controllers</a> from <a href="http://www.theguitarmania.com/">Guitar Mania</a>.<span style="font-size: 0pt"></span>
<blockquote>The exciting new Freedom V wireless guitar controller offers a 100 foot radius of Auto- Sense 2.4GHz wireless connectivity for up to 800 hours of play on one battery pack (4 AA batteries not included). It includes a patent-pending recessed Start button, which prevents players from accidentally pausing the game, and a finely tuned, highly responsive chrome Super Whammy System whammy bar, which incorporates a heavy gauge coil spring for extreme durability. Players love the feather-touch sensitivity of the buttery fret buttons on the fast-action neck, and its Smart Bidirectional Accelerator sensor allows players to simply "Tilt Upwards" the controller to enter the Star Power bonus mode of the game-instead of having to play the controller while raising the guitar vertically. The Rocking Rhythm strum bar has been tuned for a tighter feel and a more precise response, and all Guitar Mania controllers are made of environmentally friendly materials, which have passed the stringent RoHS standard set forth by the European Union.</blockquote>
