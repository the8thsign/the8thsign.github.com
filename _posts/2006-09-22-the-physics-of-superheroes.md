Now this is pretty cool (read geeky). James <span>Kakalios</span> is a Physics professor at the University of Minnesota and teaches a class called "Everything I Know About Science I Learned from Reading Comic Books". Where was this guy when I was taking Physics? He has published a book called The Physics of Superheroes and gives speeches to Sci-Fi and Comic conventions.

Here is a clip from a recent convention talking about one of my favorite comic book characters Gwen Stacy and the physics behind her death.
