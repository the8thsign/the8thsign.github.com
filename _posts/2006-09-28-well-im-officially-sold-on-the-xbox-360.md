With yesterdays official announcement of Guitar Hero II coming to the Xbox 360 with a new controller, it pretty much decided I was going to be getting a Xbox 360. Since GH2 isn't going to be released until next year, I was just going to wait until after the holidays to pick one up. Well lo an' behold, sitting in my inbox today was a email from Gamestop saying they are currently running a promotion that will give you $80 trade in for your Xbox towards a Xbox 360. $319.99 for a Xbox 360 Premium. And on top of it they are give a $10 credit for trading in 3 games and I just happen to have 3 DS games I was going to trade in. Woohoo. So I should be picking up a Xbox 360 Premium for under $299.

The announcements of the HD DVD for $199 and the Marvel MMO pretty much solidified it for me. I'll be picking it up tomorrow if I get paid, if not its going to have to wait until next weekend. I play on picking up Dead Rising as it seems like the only game worth playing for the 360 right now.

I'm going to miss my Xbox and XBMC but I'm going to take out my chip and HDD and maybe pickup another down the road if the Apple iTV disappoints. I just wish Microsoft would just enable streaming mpeg4 video. No one gives a shit about Media Center!! I mean people might if it was more like XBMC but its not and probably never will be.
