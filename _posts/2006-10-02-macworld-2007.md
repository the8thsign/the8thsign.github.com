I'm headed to Macworld 2007 in San Francisco. Got my free exhibits pass, booked the hotel room and requested days off from work already. I still need to book the get my flight tickets which I should have taken card of in a week or two. I'm still up in the air if I want to purchase the Users pass which included the Keynote. I have until Dec to really decide that tho. When I requested my PTO, my manager kinda looked at me and said it was still a busy time so I hope it wont be a problem. I did tell him my flight and hotel were already booked and said its ok. So we will see.

I'm excited. This is my first trip ANYWHERE. Never been on a plane before either so I'm looking forward. If anyone else is going to be out there for Macworld, drop me a line and maybe we can hook up while I'm out there.
