<a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a>, my favorite blog editor, has FINALLY released a <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/archives/001733.php">Intel build of 2.4.1</a>. I have been waiting for almost a year for this. While the PPC build worked under Rosetta, it was painfully slow. I have been popping around between ecto, <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock's</a> builtin blog tool and surprisingly <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1">Windows Live Writer</a>. I can now happily say ecto is back in my dock. Now if only ecto 3.0 would hit the inter-tubes before the end of the year.
