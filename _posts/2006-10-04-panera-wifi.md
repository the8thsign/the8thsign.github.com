I'm here at Panera Bread having a Iced Green Tea trying to get some work done because my power is off at the house and can't get online. I had a bright idea of coming down here to get some lunch and leech me some bandwidth. What a mistake that was. While lunch was good, their free WiFi sucks. I'm connected but can hardly pull up any webpages, update RSS feeds or even see if i have emails. I wrote a blog post for another blog of mine and it wont even post so I doubt your going to see this one. I might head down the road and hit Starbucks but you have to pay for that. I'll be in work in an hour so thats probably a waste of time and money at this point. *sigh*
