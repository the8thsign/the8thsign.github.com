Apple now has the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/">new trailer </a>for Frank Miller's 300 available in High Definition. This movie looks fucking amazing and its actually the first movie I've been excited to see in a long time. I'm definitely going to be checking this out opening night.

Head over to <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/hd/">Apple</a> to check out the trailer in 480p, 720, and 1080p.
