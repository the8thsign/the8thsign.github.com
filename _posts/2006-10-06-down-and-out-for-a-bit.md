I'll be bringing in my Macbook to repair my <a href="http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/">RSD</a> problem today. I hope its only a week but <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/10/05/taking-it-too-far/">Paul Stamatiou</a> just got his back after 4 weeks. Christ. Since this is my only computer at the moment, I'm not really sure what I'm going to do if it takes 4 weeks. I have everything backed up on a firewire drive so If i need to pick up a $599 Mac Mini, so be it.

In the meantime, my only entertainment will be my new Xbox 360, as long as that doesn't die on me <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/10/03/the-tale-of-3-xbox-360s/#comment-1123">again</a>. My Xbox Live gamertag is "the8thsign". Feel free to add me since I'm probably going to be spending most of my time there for the next week or so.

Focker Out.
