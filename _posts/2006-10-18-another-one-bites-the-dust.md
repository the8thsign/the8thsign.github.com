While my 4th Xbox hasn't totally died on me yet, it has been plagued with numerous problems.  Its locked up on me, lost several hours of gameplay due to disc read errors, and the occasional system error screen when booting up. Talked to the guy at gamestop yesterday and said he would exchange it if I would like even tho its past the return policy. To thank him I pre-ordered Gears of War Collectors Edition. I also picked up a memory card so i can save my profile and games because I'm not losing my progress in Dead Rising. I almost have the Zombie Genocider achievement and, probably would have already if I didn't lost hours of zombie killing due to lockups and disc read errors.

Since Xbox.com support was down yesterday (its still not up btw), I wrote an email to Major Nelson chronicling my plight so far.  AFter that I jumped on some forums and the first few pages of each were posts about peoples Xbox 360s failing on them. That has me worried because from what i understand, Xbox's warranty is only 90days. So I'm going to pick up the extended warranty from Gamestop when I pick up my new 360 today. The people at the Gamestop have been patient and understanding but I doubt they will keep doing this for me.
