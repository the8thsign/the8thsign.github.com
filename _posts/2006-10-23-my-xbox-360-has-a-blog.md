Its been a whole week and not one Xbox 360 problem yet. I may have a winner here folks. I did get a extended 1 year warranty with this one so it figures it will work flawlessly.  To celebrate this stunning achievement,  I've set up a blog for my Xbox 360 over at  <a href="http://www.360voice.com/">360Voice</a>. Stop by to see what my 360 has been up too.
