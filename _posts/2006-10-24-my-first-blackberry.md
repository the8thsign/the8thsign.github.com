I bought my first Blackberry this past week and I love it. I was eyeing the new Blackberry Pearl for a bit but didn't really think about switching to it until I talked to Jon over at <a href="http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/">www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com</a> who <a href="http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/2006/10/05/new-phone/">recently</a> picked one up. I have to just say right off the bat, this is the best phone I have ever owned. The Pearl does everything I would of dreamed of and then it does more.
