Face it, Myspace is dead. Don't believe me? Bookmark this post and come back in 1 year. You probably wont even have a Myspace account any longer. Its gotten so bad that i deleted my account. Most sites i lost interest in, I just leave and forget about but not Myspace. I want to rid myself of every part of it. It have because so overrun with 16 year olds, bots and advertisements its unbearable.

So with Myspace dead, where do we go now? Facebook looks like the next logical step. Its already had a strong following but now anyone can sign up, not just students.  Simple interface with lots of features like photos, bookmarking and notes, its a welcome improvement from Myspace.

As for me? You can find me where all the cool kids hang out over at <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jadedhalo/">Last.fm</a>.
