Setting your Blackberry 8100 (Pearl) to work with Gmail is pretty straight forward. There is two methods you can use but I'm only going to cover the one I'm currently using. I'm going to assume you have the Unlimited Data plan and its working and have already set up your blackberry.net address.  This instructions are geared towards T-Mobile users but should be easily modified to fit your provider.

<strong>Gmail Setup</strong>

1) Log into <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> and goto Settings
2) Click on the Forwarding and Pop tab at the top
3) Check "Enable POP only for mail that arrives from now on"
4) Save Changes

<strong>Blackberry Setup</strong>

1) Log into <a href="https://my.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>
2) Under Messaging, click on "Set Up Blackberry Internet E-mail"
3) Click "Setup Account"
4) Enter your @gmail.com address and password
5) You should now receive a TXT message saying your account has been successfully setup

You should now start receiving your Gmail emails almost instantaneously.

<strong>Filters
</strong>
One small problem you will notice with Gmail is that every time you compose a new email or reply to one, you receive a copy of that email on your Blackberry. Its annoying to say the least. We can fix this with a Server side filter.

1) Log into <a href="https://my.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>
2) Under Messaging, click on "Set Up Blackberry Internet E-mail"
3) Click the Filters icon under your Gmail account
4) Click "Add Filter"
5) Create a Filter name. This can be anything, I call mine "Gmail Sent"
6) Choose "From field" in the Apply Filter when:
7) Type your gmail.com address in the "Contains Field"
8) Select "Do Not forward messages to handheld"

You should now no longer receive replys on your Blackberry.
