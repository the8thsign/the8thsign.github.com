About a week or so I was approached by a reporter about my Macbook randomly shutting down. He had read a few of my posts over at <strong><a href="http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/">http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com</a></strong><strong> </strong>and was interested in my story. We talked for about 15 mins or so detailing the last 4 months or so of my RSS problem. Looks like the article was published and you can read it over at <strong><a href="http://www.macnewsworld.com/rsstory/53984.html">MacNewsWorld.com</a></strong>.  I'm mentioned in the <strong><em>Company Focus Stretched Thin</em></strong> section if your curious.
