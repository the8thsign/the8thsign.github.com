<a href="http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/?id=196&amp;cs=5WIGUVG5">Comic Collector Live</a> caught my eye today. Right now its just vaporware but it looks to be a kinda barterbee.com for comic books. Details are alittle light right now but from what I can tell its going to have desktop software that will catalog your comic library and actually asset its value. From there you will be able to buy and sell comics with other users. If this somehow becomes the Delicious Library of Comics I will be in my glory. I have 4 boxes of comics here that I've been trying for the past year to go through and sell what I don't want and buy what I need to finish runs. This looks to be a killer app for me if its done right.
