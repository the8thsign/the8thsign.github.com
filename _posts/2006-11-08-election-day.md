Today was election day here in the US. I live in CT so our race was of some interest this year with eyes on Joe Lieberman.  Well, he won. Oh well. I can't really complain because I didn't vote today. I wanted to but I've moved so many times in such a short period of time, I'm not sure where I'm even registered to vote anymore. So it looks like another 4 year with Joe "Mortal Kombat" Lieberman.
