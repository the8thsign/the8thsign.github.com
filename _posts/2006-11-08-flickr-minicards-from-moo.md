Remember those free <a href="http://www.moo.com/flickr/">Flickr Minicards</a> from Moo a few weeks ago. After one lost shipments and a couple emails, I finally received mine today. Very nice alternative to business cards. My photos didn't come out that great which I attribute to all of them being taken with my old shitty HP Photosmart 315 camera. The <a href="http://www.moo.com/skype/">Skype Minicards</a> looks really cool too but while I have a Skype account, I do not have a SkypeOut account.
