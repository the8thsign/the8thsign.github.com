Wow. What a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/06/games-shipping-this-week/">week</a> for games. I picked of Gears of War and Elite Beat Agents yesterday, been playing Guitar Hero II and waiting on my 360's HD DVD drive.

Monday night I grabbed some Guinness and rocked out with my cock out all night on Guitar Hero II for PS2. I didn't buy GH2 for PS2 cuz I don't have a PS2 anymore and I'm waiting for the 360 version. But my roommate has it and thats all i need. I just about finished it on medium but stopped after Hanger 18 because my hand was cramping from playing so much. I have yet to play Co-op but I will soon enough. The game is awesome but my only grip is that the song selection isn't as fun to play as the first one. The first one had some more modern songs on it and GH2 doesn't at all. I think the newest song is Monkey Wrench by The Foo Fighters. I would have liked to see some more current hits like in the original. Other than that I'm hooked.

The big news this week is Gears of War for the 360. Now, I never got caught up in the hype of this game for the past year. I didn't even know it was 3rd person until about a week ago.  I ended pre-ordering the Collectors Edition from Gamestop just based on what I've been hearing in the past month or so. Picked it up yesterday and played from about 4pm to about 4am completing almost the entire game. I was having a bitch of a time on the final boss so I called it a night. Got up today and must have died 60 times to the end boss before finally beating him and the game.  The game is awesome. Not sure if its the best game I've ever played but its good, really good. I can't remember the last time I spent any more than 2 hours in a row on one game and I just sat through 12 hours of this. I've never had this much fun dying in a game before.

I also got Elite Beat Agents for the Nintendo DS. With all day and night playing GoW, didn't really spend time with it. I popped it in right before I went to sleep just to check it out. Its kinda like a Phoenix Wright+Space Channel 5+Dance Dance Revolution mashup. I got by the first song and it was really fun. I'll try to play alittle more tonight if i can.
