<a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/connect360">Connect360</a> was just updated today to support Video streaming. Connect360 allows Music, Picture and now Video access from your Mac to your Xbox 360. It will scan your iTunes and iPhoto libraries and share them to your Xbox 360 over the network. I love this program and is a must have for any Mac and Xbox 360 owner. Version 2.8 just added streaming Video support that was added to the Xbox 360 in the Fall Dashboard update. After you install the new version and start the service, it will index your "Movies" folder . Right now its only WMV support as thats all the Xbox 360 supports but I'm hoping they will find a way to support transcoding mpeg4 files somehow.
