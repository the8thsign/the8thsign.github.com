Its my <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/download/birthday_bitches.mp3">Birthday Bitches</a>! Today is my 28th Birthday and I have to work today. Blah. My manager said she would buy me dinner tonight so atleast I'll get something out of it. I did the annual dinner ritual this weekend and my love spoiled me with presents which included the new 20th anniversary <a href="http://www.transformersthemoviedvd.com/">Transformers: The Movie DVD</a>. Spend most of my day off yesterday watching all the commentary on the DVD which was really good.

<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/friendsofxbox/gamerspeak/20061113-happybirthday.htm">It also happens to be the 5th birthday of the Xbox and 4th for Xbox Live</a>.
