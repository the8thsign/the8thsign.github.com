Let do alittle experiment.

V for Vendetta HD DVD was in my Netflix queue and went into "Processing" at about 10:30 am today. At about the same time, I was checking out the new Video Marketplace on my 360 and one of the (only) HD movies they offer is V for Vendetta. I rented it from the Marketplace for $6 and it started to download. I tried to cancel my Netflix queue but it was too later as it was already in Processing. So both are on there way. Lets see which one makes it first.

<strong>Update 1</strong>:
At around 6pm tonight, I was around 7% for the download and V for Vendetta had already shipped from Netflix with an arrival date of 11/24.

<strong>Update 2:</strong>
Checked my download at 1am  and my  download has stopped. Not sure how long its been. There is no Active Download nor any movies in my Video section. So I've restarted my download.

<strong>Update 3</strong>:
Download died once again at around 3am last night. Restarted at about 3:45am. Woke up at 11am to find it had stopped again. Restarted right away.  Currently at 3%. Download restarted at 0% at the 3am for whatever reason.  No mail today due to Thanksgiving holiday.

<strong>Update 4</strong>:
Came home from Thanksgiving at around 2pm today to find I was logged out of Xbox Live and my download has stopped one again. Restarted download as soon as I logged back in. Download is currently at 8%. Mail came today but no Netflix packs. The race is still on.

<strong>Update 5</strong>:
Just got home from work at 2:44am and the download is still going. Woohoo! Maybe they are finally fixing the bandwidth issues at MS. File is only 27% tho. Mail should be here in about 8 hours.
