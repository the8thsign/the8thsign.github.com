<a href="http://revision3.com/geekdrome/">Geekdrome</a> is no more. Dan Trachtenberg left a <a href="http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2298">post</a> of the <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3</a> <a href="http://revision3.com/forum/">forums</a> today stating he was leaving Geekdrome.

I'm actually kinda floored by this. Geekdrome was the one thing I looked forward to each week. I just started watching it again about two months ago and because of it I have since subscribed to Netflix so I can watch more movies, started watching Battlestar Galactic and started reading comics again just from watching Geekdrome.

Wow. This sucks.

From the current forum posts, Jonathan London looks to be starting a new show of under Revison3 so keep you eyes on the <a href="http://revision3.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=7">geekdrome forums</a> for an announcement soon.
