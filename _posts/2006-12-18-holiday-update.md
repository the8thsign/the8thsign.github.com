Gearing up here for the holidays. Tomorrow is my last day off before Christmas and I plan on getting all my shopping done. Other than that, I've been on a major media rush for the past month.

I've started watching alot of TV shows. Finally started watching Battlestar Galactica, Veronica Mars, and Grey's Anatomy. All which are better than the hype and I suggest you check them out in case your haven't yet.

Recently subscribed to Netflix and been loving it. There HD-DVD selection is about as good as it gets and Blockbuster is giving away free rentals in exchange for the Netflix flaps you usually toss out. So its safe to say I've been getting my movie on lately too.

In addition to Netflix, I signed up for Gamefly too tho my experience has been no where as good as with Netflix. I'm currently playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance and its really fun so far. A must get for any Marvel Comics fan.

Speaking of Marvel, thanks to Geekdrome, god rest its soul, I've gotten back into reading comics. I've been stockpiling them for almost 2 years but could never find a good "in" to start. Enter Civil War, it seemed like the perfect story arc to jump back in. Major story arc and most major comic titles are involved, the perfect time start. I got alot of catching up to do before I'm current but its been a great story so far. I'm also reading all the titles involved so it will be a couple weeks until I'm caught up. I started with Road to Civil War and I'm about 30 issues in with about 35 left.

Hope everyone has a Happy Holiday.
