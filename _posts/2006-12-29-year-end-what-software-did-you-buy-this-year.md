Lifehacker has a nice <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/ask-the-readers/ask-the-readers--what-software-did-you-fork-over-cash-for-this-year-224111.php">post</a> of software that there readers have bought this year and has turned into somewhat of a Meme with <a href="http://marcusvorwaller.com/blog/archives/2006/12/25/a-year-of-shareware/">Marcus Vorwaller</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/12/27/what-apps-did-you-buy-this-year/">Paul Stamatiou</a>, <a href="http://www.glennwolsey.com/2006/12/28/what-apps-did-you-buy-this-year/">Glenn Wolseyand</a>,  and <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/2006/12/what-apps-did-you-buy-this-year/">Ronald Heft, Jr</a> all jumping in too. Since this was my first year with a Mac, I thought it was a great idea to post mine. I think I bought more software for my Macbook this year than I've ever bought for the PC combined.

<a href="http://www.appzapper.com/">AppZapper</a> - Great for cleaning up Apps and I mess around alot and with my small HD, every megabyte counts. Also nice for extending trials as I can just zap everything but the app and my trial resets.

<a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/comicbooklover/">ComicBookLover</a> - Worth ever penny if you read comics in digital form. One of the reasons I started reading comics again.

<a href="http://delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> - MacHeist bundle. Pretty much bought the MacHeist bundle for this alone. I can scan all my DVDs and Games into this to keep track then export right into GarageSale if I want to sell the stuff on eBay.

<a href="http://discoapp.com/">Disco</a> - MacHeist bundle. I still prefer LiquidCD to this and dont get any of the eye candy due to the intergraged Intel graphics in my Macbook.

<a href="http://www.dizzypenguin.com/automac-it/">Export Artwork</a> - Purchased this to make my life easier when I was redoing my Music library. I now use CoverScout to load new album covers.

<a href="http://www.iwascoding.com/GarageSale/">GarageSale</a> - Great if you do any selling on eBay. Intergras with Delicious Library

<a href="http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag-2.php">iDefrag</a> - Tho the Journaled Mac OS Extended Filesystem is pretty good at keeping stuff defragmented, this keeps everything performing good.

<a href="http://www.thelittleappfactory.com/application.php?app=Netflix%20Freak">Netflix Freak</a> - Help feed my netflix addiction
