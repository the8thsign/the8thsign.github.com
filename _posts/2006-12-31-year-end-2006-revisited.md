<blockquote>Just wanted to wish everyone a <strong>Happy New Year</strong>. 2006 looks to be a great year, HD looks to be taking off with LCD <strong>HDTV</strong>s prices dropping faster than Paris Hilton in a homemade video. <strong>Xbox360</strong> (finally on shelves), <strong>Playstation 3 </strong>and <strong>Revolution </strong>all dropping this year, should make it exciting in the gaming community. Hope <strong>PSP </strong>finally gets some �killer app� games as mine has been just sitting collecting dust. I have no use for $20 UMD movies. I really have no idea why <strong>UMD </strong>movies are so popular, why on earth would anyone want to watch a full length film on a screen that small is beyond me. I don�t think they are a bad idea, I�m just dumbfounded as to why they are more popular than games on the PSP. I have a couple of goals this year, first being to buy my first Mac, the plan is to pick up a Intel <strong>MacMini</strong> when they get released. I want to completely switch over to Mac for my desktop. Tho this might not happen because <strong>Windows Vista </strong>will be out this year and I�m going to definitely be all over that. I�ve really been trying to make MCE work in my home and want to see what they do in Vista MCE. Its not quite there yet in <strong>MCE </strong>2005 for me, but I�m hoping with Vista and xbox360 it will finally be what Ive been looking for.</blockquote>
That was my first post of 2006. Let take a look back.
<ul>
	<li> 	32" HD LCD TVs can be found for $500 now
Nintendo Revolution is now the Nintendo Wii
PSP never got any "killer apps" and UMD died a horrible death
Bought my first Mac but it was a Macbook and not a MacMini
Made a complete switch to Apple
Really have no interested in Microsoft Vista any longer
Vista and Xbox360 have been replaced with me waiting for the Apple iTV now</li>
</ul>
