Something bad happened.

I was playing Elite Beat Agents and got to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5VNzikzckA">Episode 11: NURSE! Gold Medal Hero or Zero!!</a>. While playing the level I was really getting into the beat and the rhythm for the level. After I beat it, I went and played it again just because it was so fun to play. Then I got curious what the song was and who it was by. A quick google search later i got my answer.

Its a freakin <a href="http://www.superbabes.net/pictures/ashlee-simpson/ashlee-simpson6.jpg">Ashlee Simpson</a> song!  Damn you pop rhythm-y goodness.

I'm so embarrassed.
