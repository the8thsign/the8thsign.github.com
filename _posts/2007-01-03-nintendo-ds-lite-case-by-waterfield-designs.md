For Christmas this year, I treated myself to a new Nintendo DS case after seeing a pre-order picture of it over at <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=1417">theory.isthereason</a>. I ordered it right before Christmas so I didn't get in until a few days ago due to the holidays.

I absolutely love this case. The quality is exceptional as to be expected from Waterfield Designs.  The case itself holds the DS Lite itself, 3 games and an extra stylus. In addition it had a zippered pouch in the back that can hold addition games, headphones, lint free rag, cash, even my iPod nano fits without it being too tight. I really couldn't ask for more in a case. The case its a little pricey at $39 but its well worth it
