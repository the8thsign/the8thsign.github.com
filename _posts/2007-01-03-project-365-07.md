Back in July, i bought a new FujiFilm V10 digital camera to replace my aging HP Photosmart 315. I wanted to get into photography a little but never found the time. Well, with the start of the New Year, I'm going to start my own Project 365 by taking a photo every day. This will help me learn more about photography and just help document my life in a whole new way.

I've already started and you can view my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594453581288/detail/">Photoset on Flickr</a>.
