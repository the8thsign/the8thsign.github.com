What are you doing? Probably the first question most us ask anyone when we talk to them. Enter Twitter.

<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a web service that allows you type in what your doing at that exact moment and have it uploaded into an RSS like feed. You can see what your friends are doing and they can see what your doing. You get get friend notifications by either the web, have an IM sent, or SMS their cell.

You can send you updates via <a href="http://twitter.com/home">web</a>, IM and SMS or if you like, you can use a standalone app like <a href="http://www.railheaddesign.com/index.php/software/twitterpost/">TwitterPost</a> or a Dashboard Widget like <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/email_messaging/twidgettwitterdashboardwidget.html">Twidget</a>. I prefer a combination of IM and the dashboard widget. One problem I have getting Twitter to work on my Blackberry Pearl. AIM uses SMS messages so I don't want to use that. GTalk would be an option as I have it installed but Twitter only allows one IM protocol to be active at one time. I'm just waiting for a mobile Twitter site or a Java app. They even have a <a href="http://blog.victoriac.net/?p=87">Wordpress Plugin</a> that  will post when making blog entries. i got pretty tired of it after a day or so tho. It was buggy and didn't work well with ecto so I uninstalled it.

I found <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> while trying to get my <a href="http://www.chrisjdavis.org/2006/11/26/lifestream-ala-wordpress/">Lifestream</a> working (which it still isn't and cant seem to figure out why) and now al ot of people are starting to use it including <a href="http://www.nickstarr.com/2007/01/02/im-all-a-twitter/">Nick Starr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thomashawk">Thomas Hawk</a>, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/11/twittering-away-the-time/">Robert Scoble</a> and <a href="http://www.wiphey.com/">Kristin Pishdadi</a>.

Please feel free to add me, I'm at <a href="http://twitter.com/jadedhalo">http://twitter.com/jadedhalo</a>, and I'll add you back.
