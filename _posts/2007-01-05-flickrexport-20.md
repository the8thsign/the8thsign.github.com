One of my firsts apps i install when I got my macbook was <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/iphoto/">FlickrExport</a>. <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/iphoto/">FlickrExport</a> adds an export option to iPhoto to send photos directly to your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account. It was a very useful program at a great price, free. When version 2.0 came around, the author decided to start charging for it. Since 1.x was working great, I saw no need to upgrade.

Well, with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594453581288/detail/">Project 365</a> in full effect, as much as it can be after 4 days, I decided to buy <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/iphoto/">FlickrExport</a> 2.0. The new photoset and pool options are what sold me. With 1.x i had to upload then goto <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr.com</a> and add all the photos i wanted to a existing set or pool. It was $22.32 for the plugin which i think is a little much and one of the reasons I never upgraded before. If it was something like $9.95, I would have bought it months ago. But it should pay for itself in no time....I hope.
