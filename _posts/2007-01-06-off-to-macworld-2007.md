This time tomorrow I'll be on a plane headed to San Francisco for Macworld. This is my first trip anywhere and my first time flying, so I'm excited. Right now I'm packing and trying to get all my ducks in a row.

My planned itinerary is:

<strong>Sunday</strong> - settle in then grab a bite to eat.

<strong>Monday</strong> - free day that I want to do some site seeing

<strong>Tuesday</strong> - going to follow the keynote online then head to the exhibit hall for 11am. Kevin Smith at 2p, Macbreak at 6pm then Macbreak Get Together at 7pm

<strong>Wednesday</strong> - exhibit hall at 10am, diggnation at 4pm then Macworld Party at 9pm

<strong>Thursday</strong> - expo at 10am and Capcom Lost Planet release party at 8pm

<strong>Friday</strong> - expo at 10am and rest of the day free for whatever. plane leaves at 10:30pm

<strong>Saturday</strong> - back home

<strong>If anyone is going and would like to meet up or just lives out there and knows some good places to eat or hang out. Feel free to contact me</strong>.
