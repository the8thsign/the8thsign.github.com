I got the chance to see Kevin Smith at Macworld this year which was definitely one of the highlights of the week.  Kevin did his standard Q and A for about an hour and a half and I was lucky enough to be pretty close to him. Maybe in the 6th or 7th row. I'm just pissed I didn't get any pictures.

I even brought my Green Arrow #1 for him to sign but the asshole I am, I left it in the hotel when we left. Damn it.

The Q&amp;A was great, with some awkward moments when fans were trying to be witty with him and it back fired. If anyone else was there, just remember the big snake, little snake thing.

I "think" he's suppose to be at the <a href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/">NY ComicCon</a> next month also. If so I'm going to try and catch him and get my Green Arrow #1 signed. Its now my mission in life.
