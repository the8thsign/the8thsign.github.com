I just happen to be San Francisco for Macworld the same day that Capcom was throwing its Lost Planet release party. You may remember <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/10/03/the-tale-of-3-xbox-360s/">something</a> about me being on my 5th Xbox 360, well, the only reason I didn't return it was because of Lost Planet. I played the E3 demo and I was hooked. I couldn't wait for this game to get released.The Release Party was good times. Free food, free drinks. They had a screen printing booth where you could get your own t-shirt made up for you. (I got two). Rock climbing wall, ice sculptures, DJ and even legos. There was about 100 stations setup for 1000 people, so I didn't really get a chance to play.I did enter the tournament tho. I was in group 4B for the tournament and placed 12th. I suck.Obviously I had the game on pre-order back here but at around 9pm they started selling the collectors edition for $75 that included a free t-shirt, poster and you could get it signed by the developers. So I got mine copy signed which is awesome.<a href="http://blog.lostplanetcommunity.com/blogs/brian.php/2007/01/12/launch_event_report">Brian Dunn has some pictures up from the event</a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46675906@N00/354832879/">Thats me baybee!!</a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594478754616/detail/">My own Flickr set</a><!-- technorati tags start --><!-- technorati tags end -->
