Wednesday at Macworld was all about diggnation. Tho I was close, I took some pretty shitty pictures. Most are either blurry, have ginormous head dude or redhed girl in all of them

The taping was awesome. Kevin and Alex got a couch from god knows where somehow and snuck in beers so it felt like a real diggnation taping.  They tossed out T-shirts, which I didn't get any and lighters, which I didn't get any.

The video of its up for members right now and should be on iTunes in a couple days. Got to see the video and you can catch me during the beginning pan of the audience.
