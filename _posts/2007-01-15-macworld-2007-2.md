<strong>Keynote</strong>
I didn't go to the keynote this year. $200 and standing in line for 5 hours didn't really appeal to me too much so I did what everyone else did, followed everything online. I followed mostly everything from <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/">Macrumors</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> with a few refreshes of a couple other sites.

What did I think?

<strong>Apple TV</strong>
I've been waiting for this. I like what they did and will probably pick one up but its definitely not the perfect device. I don't want to move all my movies into iTunes. I keep everything on a separate drive and you cannot stream from a folder.

The interface is slick and it can sync with iTunes just like a iPod so you don't have to keep your computer running. I'm probably going to pick one up anyways since I get all my TV Shows from iTunes and its convenient but I'll probably find another device down the road to replace it.

<strong>iPhone</strong>
This thing is amazing. I've said it before that when Apple drops there phone I would be be first in line to buy one. After all is said and done, I'm probably not going to get one.

Reasons:
1) Cingular. I'm a T-mobile customer.
2) Price. $599 is kinda steep tho I do think its worth every cent.
3) I've fallen in love with my Blackberry's push email from work and I'm not sure if the iPhone can do that.
4) Doubt its going to work with the Nike+iPod kit.

June is along time away, half a year. As more details get announced, I'll weigh in on my choice.

In other news, if Apple released a 120G touch widescreen iPod, that I will buy.

<strong>Apple AirPort Extreme</strong>
Nice, real nice. I want one but kinda pricy and my Macbook doesn't have N in it.

<strong>Disappointed</strong>
After dropping a bombshell like the iPhone I still felt a little disappointed with the keynote. Why?

No new iPod, no Leopard and no iLife '07.

I was actually looking forward to new Leopard details, maybe even a release date and what's new in iLife '07. I'm really hoping they overhaul iPhoto.

My guess is all that stuff will be announced soon and wasn't at Macworld do to the iPhone stealing everyones thunder.
