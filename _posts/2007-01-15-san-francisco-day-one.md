<strong>Flight</strong>
My fight was, well, underwhelming. This was my first time flying and between everything everyone was telling me and everything I was reading, I was expecting the worst.

Two Words: Weak Sauce

Took a 1:30hr flight to Washington DC, which was delayed on the runway for 45mins then had a 1hr layover before taking the 5hr flight to San Francisco. On flight movie, The Queen, sucked so I spent most of my time listening to my iPod and near the end broke out my macbook and watched a few episodes of Veronica Mars.

Only thing that sucked was when we were descending, the cabin pressure destroyed my sinuses. I'm still feeling pretty shitty because of it.

Arrived into SFO kinda late. Took a shuttle to the hotel, grabbed a bite to eat in the hotel restaurant then just chilled for the rest of the night

<strong>Hotel</strong>
I stayed at the Ramada Plaza Hotel on Market St and it is not somewhere I will be going back too either.
<ul>
	<li>homeless people everywhere</li>
	<li>free internet was so slow it was useless</li>
	<li>maids never left any washcloths</li>
	<li>vending machine was busted</li>
	<li>shuttle from airport to hotel wasn't free</li>
	<li>breakfast wasn't free</li>
	<li>bathroom had empty shampoo bottles on top of the shower</li>
</ul>
And when the shuttle dropped us off, they gave me the wrong luggage. I was lucky the women who got mine caught it in time and called my cell.

<strong>Sightseeing</strong>
Since Macworld didn't start until Tuesday, I pretty much had all day Monday to go sightseeing. Me and my buddy ended up walking  all the way from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf. Grabbed a bite then headed to Alcatraz and took the tour.  After that we walked back to the hotel and started to head for <a href="http://www.ebisusushi.com/">Ebisu</a> for sushi. After walking about 15 miles all day, we took a cab to Ebisu's. The sushi was awesome. Definitely somewhere I would go back. After we left we decided to try our luck on the Muni to get home.

Lesson #1 in SF:  Learn to use public transportation.

What cost us $20 in cab fare, cost $1.50 to get back.  Live and Learn.
