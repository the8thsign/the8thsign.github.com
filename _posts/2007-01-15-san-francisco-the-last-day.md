<strong>Final Day
</strong>Checked out for noon then decided to take the trolley down to Fisherman's Wharf. Had seen everything I wanted too at Macworld so took the last day for some sightseeing.

Just my luck, it happened to be probably the coldest day of the year in SF. I stopped off at one of the gift shops just so I could by a jacket. After I was comfortable, headed to Pier 39 for some lunch and eat at Bubba Gumps. Food was decent and got to sit somewhere warm and with a view. Pretty much just walked around the Wharf for abit and took the trolley back getting off at Lombard St.

After that headed back and off to the airport.San Francisco was fun, would have been better if it was alittle warmer and I know how to use the Muni but its somewhere I want to go back. i didnt get to see "Rollin' wit" Bob Saget's Full house or the Golden Gate Bridge and check out what I missed. Maybe next year.
