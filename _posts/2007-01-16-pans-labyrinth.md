I got to finally see Pan's Labyrinth over the weekend. Wow. Absolutely Brilliant.

First off, this is NOT a kids movie by any means and it definitely earned its R rating. Even using the word "dark fairy tale" to describe it leaves out something. Something like gothic horror feels more appropriate. While there are obviously some fantasy scenes, they feel so real and connected its hard to not take every part of this movie seriously. The movie is in spanish so its subtitled, and while some people are put off by foreign language films, I think it actually added to the film.

I'm not going to get into the plot of the movie because I think this is a movie you need to go out and see for yourself. Its only open in select cities right now but starting this Friday it will be released in a limited nationwide cities, then more theaters will be added on January 26th.
