The guys over at the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/">Icon Factory</a> released a great new <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> client for Mac OS X. I've been using <a href="http://www.frankmanno.com/widgets/twidget/">Twidget</a>  and <a href="http://www.railheaddesign.com/index.php/software/twitterpost/">TwitterPost</a> but this is going to replace both of them.

Features:
<ul>
	<li>Clean, concise UI with small desktop footprint</li>
	<li>Auto refreshing at user defined intervals</li>
	<li>Highlights new tweets since last refresh</li>
	<li>Auto show / hide when new tweets arrive</li>
	<li>Single click access to user profile pages</li>
	<li>Switch between friend and public tweets easily</li>
	<li>Keyboard shortcuts for list navigation and more</li>
	<li>Menubar app that doesn't take up Dock space</li>
	<li>Audio notification for new tweets</li>
</ul>
The interface is <a href="http://iconfactory.com/graphics/software/twitterrific/screen1.jpg">slick</a>. The program sits in your menubar and pops up when there is a new tweet.  The window has a small footprint, can be expanded to see more tweets and is semi-transparent so its not intrusive. You can even set the window to disappear after a set time so you don't have to worry about closing it each time.
