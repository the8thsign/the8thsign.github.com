Went down to my local Gamestop tonight for the WoW Burning Crusade midnight launch. I didn't have the game pre-ordered so I was just hoping to get lucky and they would have a few extra copies. No such luck. It wasn't all for nothing. I meet up with a <a href="http://www.modifiedlogic.com/wordp2/archives/56">friend</a> and we BS'd while waiting in line.

I have some pictures of the event up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/">Flickr</a>.

I'm still kinda on the fence if I want to pick up the expansion as I really don't play WoW that much. If i could have gotten it tonight, I would have but now I may just wait for the price to drop and pick it up or I just might cancel my account all together.
