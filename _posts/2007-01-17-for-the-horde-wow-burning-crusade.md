After striking out last night trying to score a copy of WoW: Burning Crusade, I stumbled into Walmart at around 2pm this afternoon and walked out with a copy hassle-free. (side note, they had PS3's in stock but no Wii's). Got home, installed 4 disc and about 14 updates, then made a new Blood Elf on Bleeding Hollow. After 20mins of going through names that were already taken, Xan was born. I decided to make a Warlock instead of the standard issue Paladin. I really haven't made a magic user yet and with Mana Tap, Warlock seemed prime.

Got to level 6 tonight just running around doing all the starter quests. Ton of people in the Blood Elf starting town but the servers seemed stable with no noticeable lag. I picked up all my spells and learned my first summon then called it quits for today. I'm definitely not hardcore about WoW as most others are. I play when I can and but maybe Burning Crusade will get me a little more involved.

I'm going to jump on now and do some more quests and maybe let my Imp, Volrot, go apeshit on some stuff.  He's like a spider-monkey on meth. I love it.
