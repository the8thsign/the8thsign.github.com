I rely heavily on RSS feeds to get my daily fix of news. As you can see above, I don't read a <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=1684">ridiculous</a> amount of feeds but enough to keep me busy most of the day. One of the problems I'm starting to notice is that I'm spending a lot of time online just to keep up. I'm not sure how other people use RSS but i read everything that comes in. Maybe not "read" it all but definitely skim over the article. In the last 30 days, I've read over 24,000 articles. Thats a lot of reading and a lot of time invested to not fall behind. This reared its ugly head during my trip to Macworld this year. The internet at the hotel was so bad it was just about unusable unless it was early in the morning. So while I tried to keep up on stuff, I fell behind to the tune of about 3,000 unread items by the time I got home. It took me hours to just get through everything and catch up.

I'm finding I want to be doing more stuff on and off the computer but feel tied to my RSS reader. Catch up on podcasts, blog, World of Warcraft, watch TV shows, Netflix, workout, play my Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS, photography etc.  I work nights so my time is split up between before work and after so I can't just do a lot of stuff.

I've been bouncing around news readers for awhile, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/home.aspx">Newsgator</a>, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>, <a href="http://kula.jp/software/endo/">endo</a>, <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> to name a few in the past months. I've settled on Google Reader due to its web interface so I can access my feeds from both home and work. It's missing some nice features of desktop clients but its ability to be "everywhere once" outweighs everything else. One feature I missed was <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdId=NetNewsWire&amp;ProdView=features">Dinosaurs</a> in <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>. Basically It showed outdated feeds that haven't updated in awhile.

Enter Google Reader <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/?page=trends">Trends</a>.

It shows statistics based on your feeds. This includes what your reading, what your starring and what your sharing along with subscription based stats such as frequently read and inactive. Inactive is what I've been missing. It shows me the Top 10, 20 and 40 feeds that haven't been updated.

So starting today I'm going to "trim the fat" as they say. I'm going to start deleting feeds that I don't really need or want to keep up on. This should help me feel less tied down and hopefully free up some more time do so other things. I'm also going to start using the <a href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/sharing.html">Sharing</a> feature in Google Reader to share what I find interesting. You can see my Shared page at <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/17007536064916393533">http://www.google.com/reader/shared/17007536064916393533</a>. You can even subscribe to it to keep up to date.

My <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=5735">current OPML</a> file is up on <a href="http://share.opml.org/">Share your OPLM</a> if you're interested in what feeds i read. This is the original file I will be trimming. I'll post my new file when I'm finished.
