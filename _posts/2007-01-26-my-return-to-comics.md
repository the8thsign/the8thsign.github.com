Back in the early 90's I was big into comics like most kids my age. But as I got older and entered high school and all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_cover">gimmicks</a> started with Marvel, I pretty much walked away.

And thats how it stayed until about 2002 when I found out <a href="http://www.silentbobspeaks.com/">Kevin Smith</a> was writing comics such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Arrow-Quiver-Book-1/dp/1563899655">Green Arrow</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daredevil-Vol-1-Guardian-Devil/dp/0785107371/sr=8-39/qid=1169839235/ref=sr_1_39/103-1149956-1691034?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Daredevil</a>. This made me start looking at comics again and started getting weekly issues. At this time, I still owned my own business and really didn't have time to go back and catch up on story lines and actually read weekly comics. But I still kept a pull list for about 3 years. The comics started to add up week after week and I never got around to reading any really. I did a small run of Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Spider-man and tried to pick up X-treme X-men but that was really it. In 2005, I finally canceled my box at my local comic store as I was planning on moving in the next few weeks and was tying up loose ends.

2006 came and I was starting to get back into podcasts thanks to <a href="http://www.revision3.com/diggnation">diggnation</a> and <a href="http://www.revision3.com/">Revision3</a>. I happen to catch the Kevin Smith <a href="http://revision3.com/geekdrome/2006-01-18">interview</a> on Geekdrome but didn't really start watching Geekdrome until about episode 39 and feel in love with it. This started me back on a comics somewhat but not until <a href="http://www.geekscape.net/">Geekscape</a> and <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/">iFanboy</a> recently started did I actually start reading comics.

My "in" was Marvel <a href="http://www.marvel.com/comics/Civil_War">Civil War</a>. Comics are a little hard to just jump right in but Civil War was a crossover throughout the entire Marvel Universe. I could start at the beginning of a story arc that covered a lot of books so it was a good starting point no matter which title I wanted to read. I spend the last few weeks reading Civil War from the start and all the tie-in books. This was about 80 books altogether and I finally finished last night. Since I was caught up mostly, I started going back a few episodes of iFanboy and posting on there <a href="http://revision3.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=20">forum</a>. From this I started making notes of what other books are good and I should check out.

Right after watching the first <a href="http://revision3.com/ifanboy/five">vidcast</a> of iFanboy, I went and ordered Watchmen: Absolute Edition and 300 from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>. A few days later I was looking at the <a href="http://csls.diamondcomics.com/default.asp">Comic Book Finder</a>  and found a comic shop in my area called <a href="http://www.legendsofsuperheros.com/">Legends of Superheroes</a>. I tossed the address in my GPS and off I went. I liked the store and they seemed to have a good selection of Trades which my old shop didn't. I talked to the owner some and I was pretty much hooked again. I picked up The Dark Knight Returns and the first two volumes of The Preacher TPB. As a comic book fan, its embarrassing to admit I have never read any of these but hey, you got to start somewhere.

This Wednesday I went down to Legends, picked up this weeks comics I wanted and started a box. So I'm officially back and can't wait for next Wednesday!
