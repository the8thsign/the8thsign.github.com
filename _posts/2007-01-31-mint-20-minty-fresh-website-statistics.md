<a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, the web site analytics program, recently was upgraded to version 2.0. You can check out the changes <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/about/feature_highlights">here</a>.

With all the hype about the new upgrade, I decided to take a look at it again. I had passed over Mint for <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/home/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing</a> due to Mint needing to be run locally and costing money. Well, Performancing is <a href="http://performancing.com/node/5610">dead</a> and Google Analytics just isn't that good for tracking blog stats. This afternoon i downloaded the <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/about/mint-scs.zip">Mint Server Compatibility Suite</a> and lo' and behold, my server can handle Mint like a champ. So I took the plug and dropped my $30 for the package.

I didn't want to wait until I got home so I ended up install the package from work. Only problem with work is, our proxy blocks port 21 so I couldn't FTP the files onto my server. I ended up using the web-based file manager that my host provides. It wasn't ideal but I did get it copied over and installed. The installation was a breeze. One of the easiest web packages I've every installed. Even easier than Wordpress was.

Instead of editing header files, I went the plugin route and installed <a href="http://www.dvhome.co.uk/wp-mint/">WP Mint</a> to take care of the javascript. After everything was up and running, I installed some <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/peppermill/">Pepper</a>(addon's for Mint). I only ended up keeping <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/peppermill/pepper/7/user_agent_007/">User Agent 007</a> for now. <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/peppermill/pepper/11/bird_feeder/">Bird Feeder</a> looks nice but I'm currently using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> to track RSS subscriptions. If I can figure out how to properly setup Wordpress RSS feeds with Bird Feeder, I may switch. It would nice having everything all in one place. I did finally install the <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">WP Feedburner Plugin</a> tonight and removed all the hacky .htaccess stuff that I was using for Feedburner. <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">WP Feedburner Plugin</a> makes everything nice and neat and easy to deactivate if I decide to go with Bird Feeder in the future.

If anyone knows what I need to do to make Bird Feeder play nice with Wordpress, leave a comment.
