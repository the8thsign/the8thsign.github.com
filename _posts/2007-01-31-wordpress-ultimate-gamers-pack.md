the8thsign.com is now Wii, PSP and DS friendly thanks to the <a href="http://harper.wirelessink.com/?p=105">WordPress Ultimate Gamer's Pack</a>.
<blockquote>The WordPress Ultimate Gamer�s Pack is an essential set of plugins that automatically renders an optimized version of your posts and pages when visitors come to your blog on a Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS-Lite, or Sony PSP. Each device is automatically detected, there is no configuration needed. The theme used by each plugin optimizes your blogs layout and fonts for each device. For example, the Wii Edition plugin uses the �Wii� font at sizes that provide for easy reading on TV screens</blockquote>
I unfortunately do not have a Wii or PSP to test this out on. While I do have a DS Lite, I do not have the Opera web browser for it.

If anyone has any of these devices, I would love to know how they work out for you.
