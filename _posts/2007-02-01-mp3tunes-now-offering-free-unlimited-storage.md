If you're anything like me, you spend a lot of time trying to keep your music collection backed up. If your library is relatively small, you can use iTunes 7's <strong><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/09/12/how-to-back-up-your-music-using-itunes-7/">built-in backup</a></strong> to burn to DVD. Thats all fine and dandy unless you have a large collection. In my case I need to keep my iTunes library on an external hard drive due to my Macbook's hard drive being too small to support it. This poses a problem as now I need an additional external hard drive just to back up my music. I would buy an iPod and keep everything sync'd to there but I'm waiting for the 120GB Widescreen video before taking that route.

This is were <strong><a href="http://www.Mp3tunes.com">Mp3tunes.com</a></strong><strong> </strong>comes in. They are now offering <strong><a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/cb/free">unlimited storage for free accounts</a></strong>. This means I can sync my entire iTunes music library and now have it backed up to an offsite server for free. Plus I can sync my library with other computers and stream my entire library wherever I have an internet connection.

You use a program called <strong><a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/locker/cb/downloads/#OBOESYNC2">Oboe Sync</a></strong> that scans your collection and will only uploads what has been added or changed. There is a Oboe Sync client for Windows, Mac and Linux so no one is left out. There are also <strong><a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/locker/cb/downloads/#MEDIAPLAYERS">plugins</a></strong> for iTunes, Mac and PC, and Winamp that allows streaming of your locker. In the case of the iTunes plugin, you see your locker show up under the Shared music source list. Files are streamed at 128kbps so its CD quality.

<strong>While everything sounds perfect. There are some caveats:</strong>

1) It only sync's music, no video files so any iTunes TV shows or Movies you have, you still need to back those up on your own. It will sync DRM'd music tho.
2)<strong> </strong>Syncing takes along time. This is due to your internet connection. Upload speeds tend to be a lot slower than download. For a 42GB library, I've been syncing for about a week on and off.
3)<strong> </strong>The Obeo plugin for iTunes (Mac) is not Universal binary yet.
4) All new free accounts do not have unlimited storage right away. They are adding the unlimited storage to free accounts in waves. It took me about a week after I signed up before my account was converted to unlimited.

If you're looking for a way to backup your music collection, look no father. The price is right, free, and you have the added bonus of being able to stream your music anywhere and keep multiple computers sync'd with the same library.
