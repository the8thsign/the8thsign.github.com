I just received my new issue of Wizard today and while thumbing through it, page 4 caught my eye.
<img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/DSCF1384-1.JPG" alt="Dscf1384-1" border="1" height="375" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="500" />

Wizard #185 - Page 4-5. Notice anything <strong>familiar</strong>? Maybe a certain page photo?

Its probably just a coincidence...<a href="http://gnato.deviantart.com/journal/11346085/#journal">but maybe not</a>?
