My first month of <a href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">Project 365</a> is complete.  Its been an busy month for me and I've been able to keep new idea coming but I have a feeling this is going to be a long year. Its going to be tough to photograph something new everyday but thats the kinda challenge that will make me a better photographer. I've learned a lot this month just about the way my camera works and what settings work best. I've taken some pictures I've loved and I've taken pictures I've hated.

I've also started posting my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594453581288/">Project 365</a> pictures to <a href="http://www.blipfoto.com/">Blipfoto</a>. Blipfoto is a daily online photo journal that is perfect for One-a-day photo projects.
