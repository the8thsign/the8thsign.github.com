If you visit this page via RSS, you may not of noticed I've added a "shared articles" link to my link bar. What this is is a link to my shared items on Google Reader. I use this to keep track of what article I want to follow up on or read later. So now you can see what I'm reading too. You can even subscribe to it via RSS. Since I'm constantly adding and removing items, subscribing to the feed feed might be the best way to keep up.
