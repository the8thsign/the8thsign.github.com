One of features I can't wait for with the Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/phone/">visual voicemail</a> feature. I'm a notorious caller dodger and add the fact that I do not get cell service in my house, voicemails add up fast. I'll usually check my messages and see i have 15 VM's and have to listen to all of them if I just want to hear a few.

<a href="http://www.callwave.com">Callwave</a> has a free <a href="http://www.callwave.com/landing/vm2em.asp">product</a> that replaces your cell phone provides voicemail with there own. This allows you access to each voicemail individually. You can still access it like your regular VM from your phone but you can also access voicemail's through their webpage or have them delivered right to your inbox. My personal favorite? The OS X <a href="http://www.callwave.com/landing/widgets.asp">Dashboard Widget</a>. I can see who called and when; listen and delete emails all directly from the widget.

Its a free service and its easy to setup on your phone. Took me all of 5 minutes to setup on my phone  and everything is seemless. Even pressing the voicemail button on my phone brings me directly there.
