<a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/11/08/comic-collector-live/">Remember</a> Comic Collector Live! from back in November? Yup the same one that was suppose to be released in December. Well, its still not released but in the past few weeks some interesting things have started to happen. First off Joe Butler, CEO of <a href="http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/?id=196&amp;cs=5WIGUVG5">Comic Collector Live!</a>, has posted a <a href="http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/Forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=49">screenshot</a> of the application. And that brings us to number 2, their <a href="http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/forum/default.aspx">forums</a> are live.

Today I got an email that I will be included in the next batch of beta testers. This should be next week on February 15th. During the signup, I was asked if I would be willing to sign an NDA but according to the email, I will be able to post of the public forums about the software. There will also be another beta signup on the weekend of February 16th so keep an eye on the forums.
