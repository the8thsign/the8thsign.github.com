Some of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594478754616/">photos</a> from the Lost Planet Release Party in San Francisco were recently featured in the e-zine <a href="http://efanzines.com/SFSF/">Science Fiction/San Francisco</a> issue #38. That issue is now available for free download.
