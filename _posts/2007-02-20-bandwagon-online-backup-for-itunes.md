<a href="http://ridethebandwagon.com">Bandwagon</a> is offering <a href="http://blog.ridethebandwagon.com/2007/02/16/free-accounts-for-bloggers/">free 1 year subscriptions</a> to bloggers who blog about there service before Feb 22th. Bandwagon is an online backup for iTunes. Currently I'm using <a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com">Mp3tunes.com</a> to backup my iTunes but I've been running into some problems with them. First off they just backup musics and not other media files where as Bandwagon backs up everything. Music, TV Shows, Music and even games. Also from the screenshots the application looks great. Mp3tune's Oboe Sync is for a better word, lacking. They are still working on a pricing scheme but so far I think I maybe be replacing Mp3tunes very soon.

Btw, Bandwagon is Mac only.
