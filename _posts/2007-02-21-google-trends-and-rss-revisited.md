<a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2007/01/18/rss-feeds-google-trends-and-me/">Last month</a> I started cleaning up my RSS feeds in the hope of making them less of a chore. Well, its been one month since then and I have deleted 72 feeds that have saved me 10,000 articles a month. This has helped me keep my RSS feeds manageable and I no longer feel like I'm a slave to Google Reader.

One of the biggest things I did was remove digg from my RSS reader. Why? Well first off it was my highest traffic feed, so deleting it helped save me hours a day and 2nd, I also go to digg.com anyways to digg articles. There was no real reason to have it in my RSS reader. So now what I do is once a day goto digg.com and look through the last few pages digging and reading as I go.

I can still trim a little more in the way of feeds but for now I'm a lot more productive during the day as I'm not tied to my RSS reader all the time. If I delete my new top traffic feed, techbargians.com, I can save another 2500 articles a month and probably some money too since I won't see all the great bargains that I "must" have.
