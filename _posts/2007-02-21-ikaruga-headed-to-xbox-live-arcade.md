<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a>, the pseudo-sequel to <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/shmups/reviews/radiantsilvergun/index.html">Radiant Silvergun</a>, is probably the last great shooter. Originally released on the Dreamcast in Japan and then in the US on the Gamecube, it now looks like it may be <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=158009">headed to Xbox Live Arcade</a>.  The game has been seen in an unplayable form on the Xbox debug machines.

For those who haven't played it, its a vertical shooter where you change "polarity" so you can absorb that color bullets. Its hard to explain but it makes it for a new (and difficult) twist on the classic shooter. I would love to see Radiant Silvergun come to XBL too but thats just wishful thinking.

First <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/09/enough-talk-have-at-this-castlevania-xbla-video/">Castlevania: SOTN </a>and now this. XBL is quickly becoming the "killer app" for the Xbox 360.
