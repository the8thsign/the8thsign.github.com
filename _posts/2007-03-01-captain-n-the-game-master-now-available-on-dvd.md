<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_N:_The_Game_Master">Captain N: The Game Master</a> was one of those Saturday morning cartoons I watched religiously. Where else could I mixed my two favorite things as a child, cartoons and video games, in one package. I still have nightmares of Motherbrain and her drag queen voice.

All 3 seasons are finally available now in one 4 disc DVD set. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Captain-N-Game-Master-Complete/dp/B000JBXHVY/sr=8-1/qid=1172611543?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;tag2=bitbytpixspr-20">Amazon</a> has the set listed for $29.99 and I've already added it to my Netflix queue.
