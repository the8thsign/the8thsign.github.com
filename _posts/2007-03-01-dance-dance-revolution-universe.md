Dance Dance Revolution Universe was <a href="http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/02/27/shipping-this-week-get-on-the-floor-edition/#comments">released</a> this week for the Xbox 360. The soundtrack sports over 65 tracks with even more downloadable via Xbox Live. The game comes with a bunch of new modes, with new modes geared toward beginners and multiplayer.

I've been waiting for a new DDR game for awhile and I'd probably going to pick this up. I'd really like to see some reviews about the pad first tho. I don't have the room for the pad without moving some stuff around but with Guitar Hero II coming out (hopefully) next week, I'm going to have to make some room anyways. I'll wait a week and see what kinda reviews pop up about the pad itself but IGN gave DDRU a 8.7 and winning its <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/768/768200p1.html">Editors Choice award</a>.
