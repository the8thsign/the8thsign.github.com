During a <a href="http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/02/27/comicmix-podcast-7-arrives/">podcast</a> this week, legendary comics creator Neal Adams <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=9821">announced</a> that he and Frank Miller are both working together on a new Batman mini-series titled Batman: Odyssey. This is awesome news but I'm still alittle wary with Frank Miller. After Dark Knight Returns, Miller has been a little, umm, less than award winning with his Batman stories.

cough*dark knight strikes back*cough*all-star batman*cough.

Regardless I'll be buying it when the 6 to 8 part series comes out. No word on when it should start but I would imagine sometimes in the next few months.
