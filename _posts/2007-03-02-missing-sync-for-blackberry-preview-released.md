Mark/Space released a <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_bb_issues.html">public preview</a> of The Missing Sync for BlackBerry on Wednesday. <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_blackberry.php">The Missing Sync for Blackberry</a> allows you to sync your Blackberry with your Mac. This includes calendar, contacts, tasks, notes and iPhoto and iTunes if you have a 8100 or 8800.  Ever since I seen this product demo'd at Macworld back in January, I've been waiting for this.

I've been using Pockmac 4.0 which is provided free from RIM themselves and I've been lucky enough to not have any real problems like others have. I've been testing the preview out for 2 days now its been rock solid for me. I did have to completely uninstall PocketMac for Missing Sync to work however.  I'm loving the fact that I can sync on connect now and the iTunes/iPhoto intergration is awesome too.

The preview demo is good for 40 days so it looks like the final product should be shipping by the end of this month like expected. While $40 is a lot for a syncing program, I've read they will be offering 50% off if you cross-grade up from one of there other products. Lucky for me I fall into this as I purchased The Missing Sync for Windows Mobile when I still had my MPx220.
