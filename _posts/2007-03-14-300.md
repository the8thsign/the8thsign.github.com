I got to see 300 over the weekend. I've been waiting along time for this and its the first movie since 2005 I've gone to see in the theaters. The movie was amazing and was well worth the wait. I can truly say you have never seen another movie like it. I bought the graphic novel of 300 a few months back but have held off reading it since the movie was right around the corner. Now thats its now, I think I may take the weekend and read it just to get a feel just how close of an adaptation it was. The next day I have off during the week, I'm going to go see it at an IMAX theater.
