Back in 2005 I started working out and eating better and generally felt the best I've had in years. In early 2006 I started a new job and had just moved. Since then I never really got back on the fitness wagon. Since then I've re-developed the gut I worked so hard to get rid of. Well, I've decided that this month is going to be my month to get back on track.

At the beginning of the month I finally picked up a pair of Nike+ Air Max Moto IV I've been wanting since last August.  Armed with my Nike+iPod kit I'm just starting off with running for the next 6 weeks. Right now I'm using the Beginners 5K Schedule from nikerunning.com and its been working out good for me so far.

To keep track of my progress I'm using <a href="http://www.traineo.com/">Traineo</a>. Traineo is fitness web2.0 style. It allows you to keep track of your workouts, diet, weight and more. The biggest feature is that you can add motivators who get weekly updates of your progress via email or anyone can subscibe to an RSS feed of your progress. You can also join different groups and chat in forums.

I've only been back for two weeks but it feels good to run again. With my schedule I'm going to the gym after work which is about 1:30am. Its nice because there is minimal people there and I don't have to wait for machines and showers. This works well for 3 of the 4 days I workout but Friday the gym closes early so I'm still debating how I'm going to handle Fridays.
