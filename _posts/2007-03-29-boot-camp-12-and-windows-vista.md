Tuesday night I finally had some free time and decided to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/438879307/">install</a> Vista Ultimate on my Macbook.  My Parallels install of XP MCE 2005 is getting full and I needed to reinstall anyways. Well would you know my luck, less that 12 hours after I installed Vista, Apple releases a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Vista compatible version of Boot Camp</a>. Thank god its just an updated driver CD and I don't have to repartition and reinstall.

I just wish Parallel's supported Vista on a Boot Camp partition so I didn't have to reboot but the only two things i really need Windows for is to watch Netflix streaming movies and Comic Collector Live.  Its only a matter of time for Parallels supports it and I can wait.
