I'm taking the week off from the gym this week. I'm just exhausted and sore and need some time to rest. I'll restart my 5K schedule this monday again but in the meantime I picked up Dance Dance Revolution Universe for the Xbox 360 to keep up on my exercise while I'm not at the gym.

The selling point for me is the Workout mode. When you turn of Workout mode, the game will calculate how much calories you are burning while playing any of the modes in the game. From the workout mode screen you can adjust your weight and get a graph of your calories burned by each day. This makes it easy to enter into <a href="http://jadedhalo.traineo.com/">Traineo</a> for me and its a nice way to keep up with your progress.

My biggest problem seems to stem from the all hardwood floors in this house. Everything shakes while I'm playing because there is nothing to absorb the vibrations. I picked up some interlocking fitness mats from Walmart and they seem to help some, but when I have to jump on double arrows, I'm afraid I'm going to end up in the basement.
