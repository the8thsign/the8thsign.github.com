The Totally Rad Show is a new Revision3 show featuring Alex from diggnation, Dan from Geekdrome and Jeff Cannata from who knows where. The show is a weekly review show featuring the latest movies, comics and video games. Its hard not to see the comparisons to Geekdrome, especially with the fact that Dan was one of the hosts of Geekdrome and there was even an episode of Geekdrome that featured Dan, Alex and Jeff all together. But thats neither here nor there.

For me iFanboy and TRS have been replacement for Geekdrome . I know Jonathan London is doing his thing with Geekscape but Geekscape has just been bothering me lately for some reason and I can't put my finger one it. I've been LOVING iFanboy tho and hopefully TRS will fill  the movie, TV and video game part of Geekdrome I miss so much.

Anyways, you can download The Totally Rad Show from <a href="http://revision3.com/trs">Revision3</a> or subscribe to it via <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=250463619&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a>.
