<p align="left">With the start of Spring, I thought it was time for layout change. I'm not sure I'm completely happy with the current one but I'll work with it some more. You may see some weird stuff with the site over the next week or so as I tweak stuff to my liking. If you read the RSS feed, stop by and tell me what you thing or if you don't read the RSS feed, what are you waiting for? <a href="feed://www.the8thsign.com/feed/">Subscribe Here</a>
