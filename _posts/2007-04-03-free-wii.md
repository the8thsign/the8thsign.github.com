Still having trouble finding a Nintendo Wii 6 months after launch? Me too but the guys over at<strong><a href="http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2007/03/10120/"> UNEASYsilence are giving away a Wii Sports-less Wii for free</a></strong>. What's the catch you ask? Well for starters you need to be lucky as the winner will be picked at random and second all you need to do is spread the word about the contest. Blog about it, bookmark it on del.icio.us, digg it, twitter it, tumblr about it, they don't care. After you you link to the giveaway, just post the link as a comment and just wait. I entered the last giveaway they won but walked away empty handled but who knows about this time.
