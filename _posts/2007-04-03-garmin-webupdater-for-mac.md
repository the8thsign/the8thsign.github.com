For Christmas last year I got a Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS, which has been kickass btw. Since I'm a Mac user, I always had to boot Parallels to install the latest firmwares using the windows software. Well as of today, I no longer have to as Garmin has released a Mac version of their <strong><a href="http://www.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=3499">WebUpdater </a></strong>and also their <strong><a href="http://www.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=3498">POI Loader</a></strong>. Both programs are universal binary but are still in beta.  I just got done loading the latest firmware without a problem tho and the webupdater should work for any of Garmin's GPS products.
