<strong>Myself</strong><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/127/361133998_d27c4d4bc3_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" align="right" /> 

My name is Alec Peden and I'm 33 years old. I'm currently living in New York and work for Apple as a Lead Genius. From 2001 to 2006 I owned my own computer repair and consulting business called Navitek Computers in Shelton, CT. I hit a wall with what I was doing and decided it was time to move on to bigger and better things.

<strong>Blogging</strong>

I started blogging back in 2000 on my first site <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010309121033/http://www.jaded.org/" target="_blank">jaded.org</a>. I moved to Livejournal in late 2001 where I got my first taste of social networking. I finally left Livejournal for good and went to my own Wordpress install in 2005 here at the8thsign.com.

<strong>Geek</strong>

I'm your typical geek. My weakness is gadgets. I made the switch to Apple in the beginning of 2006 when I purchased a newly released Macbook and I haven't look back once. I was very active in the Linux community at one point back in early 2000 and helped out with many open source projects such as Enlightenment, Ximian Evolution and Eazel Nautilus. I currently have my A+, 4 MCP certificates and Apple certified.

<strong>Hobbies</strong>

Besides blogging, I enjoy comics, video games, music, movies and TV which usually eats up most of my waking hours. I'm also interested in photography and started my own Project 365 last year to help me get started. So far my pictures have been featured in:
