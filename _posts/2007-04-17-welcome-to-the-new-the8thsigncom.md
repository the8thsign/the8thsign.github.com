As you can see I have a new home, <strong><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a></strong>, and a new look (yes <strong><a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2007/04/02/new-layout-spring-edition/">again</a></strong>). While I wasn't unhappy with my old host, they were only running MySQL 3.x so I couldn't run Wordpress 2.1.x. I looked around at a new host for a few days before I settled on Dreamhost. I've read good and I've read bad but it ultimately came down to features and price. I mean I paid $23 for a full year using one of the hundreds of promo codes floating around the web.

<strong>Database issues</strong>
The transfer could have been smoother but that was partly my fault. I switched over the DNS before being fully prepared. The biggest issue I ran into was import my SQL databases. Trying to import from a MySQL 3.x to a 4.x doesn't really work that great. So I had to run the SQL queries manually. I would copy and paste the new tables followed by the inserts. One thing I wish I knew before was that wp_countries is part of Slimstats which I didn't need to import. That table itself was well over 60% of my file size. My life got much easier after I figured out I didn't need it.

<strong>Wordpress
</strong>Dreamhost offers 1 click installs and upgrades of Wordpress which I love. It was getting to be a chore manually upgrading my wordpress install everytime a new version was released. I can also now use the <strong><a href="http://freepressblog.org/wordpress-plugins-2/mint-bird-feeder-wordpress-plugin/">Mint Bird Feeder plugin</a></strong> so I don't have to update my feed files each time. So overall Wordpress has gotten a lot more hands off for me which I love. Now I can spend more time blogging instead of doing behind the scenes work.
<strong>
Mint</strong>
Getting <strong><a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a></strong> back up and running wasn't too bad. I did move Mint to its own database where as I was sharing it last time. I took the time to upgrade to the latest Mint version along with a couple outdated Peppers. Only Pepper I had problems with was <strong><a href="http://haveamint.com/peppermill/pepper/11/bird_feeder/">Bird Feeder</a></strong>. With the update to Wordpress 2.1, something didn't take. So I replaced the RSS files with the originals and downloaded and installed the WP-birdfeed plugin which adds the code on the fly. Its been working great but I lost the last 4 months worth of subscriber data.

<strong>Domain Names</strong>
My last order of business is transferring all my domain names to <strong><a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a></strong>. I just purchased <strong><a href="http://www.alecpeden.com">alecpeden.com</a></strong> after reading <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com">Paul Stamatiou</a></strong> post about <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/04/14/online-presence-and-why-you-need-it/">Online Presence</a></strong>, and loved how much control I had at Godaddy. So I'm in the middle of transferring over the last two i have with another registrar and I should be good. Right now I'm not sure what I will do with alecpeden.com but for now it redirects to here.

<strong>Dreamhost</strong>
So far I'm happy with my chose to do with Dreamhost. I'm digging having everything under one roof now. I now even have a alec @ the8thsign.com email. Shocking.

Also Dreamhost has a nice Rewards system for referrals. Someone made out of me when I used a code I found online so now you can help me out. I've created code "<strong><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?300697">the8thsign</a></strong>" to use if want to sign up and get $97 off your order. This is a referral and I do make money on this somehow but $97 off is nice. My first year went from $120 down to $23.

<strong>New Design</strong>
I know I just changed designs a few weeks ago but I was never really happy with it. So now with moving to a new host, I got a new look with I'm loving. I'm still making changes and you may see some weird stuff for the new week while i mess around but overall I'm pretty happy with its current state. I still have some work to do but it shouldn't take me long.
