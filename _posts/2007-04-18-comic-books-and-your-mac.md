Wednesday is my favorite day of the week.  I wake up, have some breakfast and wait patiently until 2pm when my <a href="http://www.legendsofsuperheros.com/">Local Comic Shop</a> opens so I can go and pick up this weeks comic books. I recently got back into comics after about 15 years thanks to podcasts like <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/">iFanboy</a> and <a href="http://www.geekscape.net/">Geekscape</a> but the real unsung hero is my Apple Macbook. Without programs like ComicBookLover, Wednesday's List and iComicsOnSale, I wouldn't have really gotten back into reading comics.

ComicBookLover aims to be the iTunes for digital comics and it comes pretty close. Its laid out in a similar fashion to iTunes with a 3 pane browser on the top, your library on the bottom and your lists on the left. You can also view by cover art.  CBL allows you to organize your entire collection by tagging the file with all the relevant information such as issue name, volume, publisher and year. Just like iTunes, it support Smart Lists. This allows you to make a List based on search criteria which I have found invaluable.

Viewing comics has an impressive feature set such as Single, Western or Manga view. You can rotate images on the screen 90 degrees and it supports dual monitors. What I like to do is rotate the screen and turn my Macbook on its side like a book to read. The 13' widescreen is almost the perfect size of a comic page. Pages are automatic sized based on which view your using and it provides an On-screen display to navigator when using Full Screen mode.

ComicBookLover will set you back $24.95 but if you read digital comics in any form, its well worth it.

<a href="http://www.railheaddesign.com/">Railhead Design's</a> Wednesday's List is a one trick pony. It pulls this weeks <a href="http://www.diamondcomics.com/public/default.asp?t=2&amp;m=1&amp;c=3&amp;s=7">Diamond shipping list</a> and allows you to print out your Pull List. The interface divides up each publisher in its own section and lists the name, <a href="http://previews.diamondcomics.com/public/">Previews</a> order number and price. Just check the box next to the comics you want and your ready to save, print or email your list. You can even sync with iCal. My favorite part is you can add in your local tax rate and it gives you a running tally for the comics you selected. I also print and bring my list with me so I know what I'm getting and what its going to cost me.

Wednesday's List costs $7 and is a Universal Binary.

<strong><a href="http://www.icomicsonsale.com/content/">iComicsOnSale</a></strong>

iComicsOnSale or iCOS is a Dashboard widget. iCOS is similar to Wednesday's List in that it allows you to print out weekly pull lists. I prefer iCOS because you can view a summary of each comic, cover, price, pages and writer/artist information. They even have a featured comic page highlighting one comic each week. That being said, I don't use iCOS for two reasons. One its a widget and would work so much better an actually program and two its very unstable for me. It uses an insane amount of memory some times and it eats my pull list. The latest version is still beta so its to be expected but I've moved to Wednesday' List for my Pull Lists because of this.

iComicsOnSale is free and they have just launched a new <a href="http://dev.icomicsonsale.com/">website</a> which lists this weeks new comics with full descriptions.

<strong><a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/">iFanboy Podcast</a></strong>

While iFanboy is not an application it is a weekly podcast and video podcast that I can't live without. And technically I subscribe to both podcasts using iTunes but thats nether here nor there. iFanboy do a audio podcast called the <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/audio_podcast.html">Pick of the Week</a> where they pick one comic for that week and discuss it along with other books that were released. It comes out every Sunday and I listen to it on my way to pick up my comics every Wednesday. Then when I get home, there video podcast is waiting for me. The <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/video_podcast.html">video podcast</a> differs from the audio as they focus on topics and not weekly books.

So definitely check there podcast out. I look forward to it each week and its always the first I listen to and watch.
