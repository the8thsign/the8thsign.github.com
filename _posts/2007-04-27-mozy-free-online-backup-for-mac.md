<strong><a href="http://mozy.com/">Mozy</a></strong> was one of my favorite programs on Windows. It's an automatic online backup system that worked very well. It was small, easy and just worked. They give you 2GB free or unlimited for $4.95/month which is incredible.

Mozy features:
<ul>
	<li> Open/locked file support</li>
	<li> 448-bit Blowfish encryption</li>
	<li> 128-bit SSL encryption</li>
	<li> Automatic or scheduled backups</li>
	<li> New and changed file detection</li>
	<li> Block level incremental backups</li>
	<li> Bandwidth throttling</li>
	<li> File versioning</li>
	<li> Public or private key encryption</li>
</ul>
Well the folk over at Mozy <strong><a href="http://mozy.com/mozy/macmozy">released a beta</a></strong><strong> </strong>for Mac today. As soon as I seen the news, I started the install. Install was a breeze and in a few minutes it was searching my hard drive for "Backup Sets" which are pre-determined file types. These include Word and Excel files and Mac specific items such as iCal, Address book, iTunes Library and iPhoto Library. You can also choose individual files and folders if you would like too. I choose my Documents and SItes folders in addition to some Backup Sets as you can see below.

So far I'm only 62% done with my initial backup so I haven't had a chance to try a restore yet. But if its anything like the Windows client was, it will be easy and seamless. So far I'm impressed by the beta. I haven't run into any issues yet but I really haven't done too much yet. The program runs in the menu bar so its out of the way. With 2GB's of space for free, you really have no reason not to be backing up important files now.
