Like <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/#" target="_blank">everyone </a>else, I went to see Spider-Man 3 this weekend. Any regular readers of my blog know I'm a big comic fan and have really gotten back into comics in the last 6 month. I loved Spider-Man 1 and even more so Spider-Man 2. This was also the first Spider-man I've seen in the theater.

I'll get right to it and say I'm not sure if I liked it. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it either.  The two things that ruined it for me were the campy parts and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.  This felt like more of Sam Raimi doing a Spider-Man movie than a Spider-Man movie directed by Sam Raimi. Anyone who has seen a Sam Raimi movie knows what I'm talking about.

<strong>The Good</strong>
I loved the Sandman in this. Thomas Haden Church did a brilliant job as the Sandman. He did a great job of bringing emotion to the character.  The CGI effects that brought the Sandman to life were mind blowing. These were some of the best effects I've ever seen in a movie before.

Eric Forman as Venom?! That was my first reaction but I got to give it to him, he nailed it. I loved Topher Grace as  Eddie Brock, tho it was weird hearing him speak as Venom.

Bruce Campbell. Nuff' Said.

I loved Gwen Stacy in this movie. I one of those people that think Peter Parker would be better off in a world with Gwen Stacy than Mary Jane. My feelings are just amplified in Spider-Man 3. They should have killed off Mary Jane in the beginning and had Peter hook up with Gwen. Much better movie by 10 fold if that happened for me.

<strong>The Bad
</strong>I hated Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane in this. Didn't care for her in the first one, was much better in the 2nd and I downright want her dead in 3. I could not see why they would be together in this movie. She cheats on him, she lies to him, doesn't trust him, is jealous of him. Why they were in a relationship at all is a mystery. The Gwen Stacy scenes were so must better and would have loved to see a lot more Gwen and a hell of a lot less Mary Jane. I really hope shes off the next movie.

This movie is really weird in its comedic aspect. It was a lot of cheese and not a lot of wit. Spider-Man is all about the witty, smart-ass one liners and those are devoid in the movie. Instead we get a campy look at Spider-Man via Sam Raimi. Its one redeeming quality is that the campiness is felt throughout the movie and doesn't veer from the path. I have to say Spider-Man 3 is what it is. For me in a movie with the emotional look at the Sandman and a terrifying look at revenge and hatred in Venom, the campy backdrop just feels out of place.

Unfortunately it seems that Marvel falls apart at number 3 with their franchises. First with X-Men 3 and now with Spider-Man 3. I don't think either are bad movies, just missed potential. I think Spider-Man just fell into doing a lot of things OK instead of doing one thing good.
