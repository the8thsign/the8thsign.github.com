This has been a quiet month for me. Well, in regards to blogging atleast. Nothing really big going on that I've felt the need to write about. I've spent the month aggressively attacking my very outstanding debt. I managed to pay down $5000 this month which is a big chunk of stuff that was in collections. Out of 7 accounts that are Charge-Off's on my credit report, I paid off 5. The two left is my smallest and my biggest.  I should have those paid off in the next 4 months I hope. I'm also looking for a place to move. I need to be out of my current place by August 1. So I've been putting stuff up on craiglist and ebay hoping to get a few extra bucks and make my move a little less painful. Also my TV died on me. I have a 32" Norcent LCD that starting giving me <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/175/482951410_c5beb643cc_b.jpg">problems</a> a few weeks ago. It's in the shop right now and I hope it can be fixed for a decent amount. I should know in about another week.

I've also applied for a promotion at work. The only other guy going for it is above me so I'm kinda in a win win situation either way. One way I get the job or if he gets it, I make a move for his. Both will require me to move to days as I work nights now but with me trying to get my financial situation under control and moving to a new place, the extra income will be nice. Its so expensive to live by yourself here in CT, I'm going to have to move in with a roommate for the next 6-12 months. By that time I will start to have rebuilt my credit and have enough money to maybe get a place of my own again. So the next couple months will be interesting and possible steps forward for me.

Alec  out.
