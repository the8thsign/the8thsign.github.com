Over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/reinkingthor/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apelad/">Ape Lad</a> has issued a challenge, Re-Ink Jack Kirby's Mighty Thor pencil's better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Colletta">Vince Colletta</a>. Page 144 of Lee/Kirby's Might Thor has been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=519001776&amp;size=o">posted</a> and it up to you to re-ink the page yourself then upload your work to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/reinkingthor/pool/">Flickr pool</a>. You can do the whole page or just a panel, its up to you. Since my artistic talent ends at stick figures and coloring books, I'm just going to enjoy everyone else's submissions.
