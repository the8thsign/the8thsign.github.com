<a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2007/06/tasks-on-plane.html">Remember the Milk</a> is the first 3rd party web app to make use of <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> for offline access. RTM is the 2nd app I use on a daily basis to be given the offline treatment; the other being Google Reader. Since Google Gears was released, I've switched back to Firefox just so I could play around with it and now I'm back to a Firefox as my main browser. Firefox 3.0 <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/firefox_3_offline_apps.php">plans to bring all web apps offline</a> and I'm now seeing how this kinda access is going to change the web once again. My guess is the Google Gears code is going to be giving back to Mozilla to incorporate into Firefox. Now if they can just release Gmail and Google Doc and Spreadsheets as offline apps I think I'd be in my glory.
