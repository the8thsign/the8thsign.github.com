I'm sure you have all seen the videos on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo">YouTube</a> of people who took a picture a day for a year and compiled it into a video. Well now thanks to <a href="http://www.flickaday.com/">Flickaday</a> you too can have faceblog of yourself from the comfort of your own home. Flickaday takes the idea and makes it super simple. Go to their website, enter your login and password and click Take my Picture. Bam! your picture is taken and its added to your collection. It uses Flash to access your webcam so no additional software is needed. They generate a widget that you can embed anywhere you'd would like, just like the one above. Even add some music. The webpage will email you if you haven't taken a picture for the day yet so you don't forget. You can only take one picture a day so make it count. I decided against this kinda project when I started <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadedhalo/sets/72157594453581288/">my Project 365</a> but the website makes it super simple so I'll be uploading my picture each day until I get tired of it.<!-- technorati tags start -->
