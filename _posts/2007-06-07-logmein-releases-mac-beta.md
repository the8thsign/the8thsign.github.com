My favorite remote control software, LogMeIn, has released a <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/mac/">preview of their upcoming client for Mac</a>. LogMeIn is similar to GoToMyPC in it provides 24/7 access to your computer from any web browser. I've used LogMeIn for years when I was doing computer consulting to remotely access clients PC and its nice to finally see it come to Macs. The client only supports LogMeIn Free accounts right now which allows access to one computer. But since its free, there is no reason not to signup for an account and have access to your home Mac anytime, anywhere.
