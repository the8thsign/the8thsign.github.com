From a recommendation from <a href="http://revision3.com/trs">The Totally Rad Show</a>, I picked up Book 1 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> from Netflix. I just finished the 5th DVD and I'm hooked on the show. While its definitely still aimed for kids, its easily enjoyed by adults. The plot revolves around Aang who is the Avatar, the last master of all the elements. The world is divided up into 4 nations, Water, Earth, Air and Fire, and the Avatar helps the balance between all the nation. Fire nation attacked the other nations 100 years ago and the Avatar disappeared. So fast forward 100 years and two children from the Water tribe, Katara and Sokka find Aang trapped in ice. After they free him they learn he is the missing Avatar and the last of the Air Benders. Benders are people who can manipulate their nations elements. So we pick up with Katara, Sokka and Aang setting out to put the different nations back in harmony. There is more going on but thats the basics.

The show offers a great mix of martial arts action, spirits, comedy and surprises. It feels like a Miyazaki film brought to life as a TV show.   And I would suggest anyone who is a fan of Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke to check out Avatar The Last Airbender.
