No, thats not the answer after a drunken night of co-ed naked Clue, its the name of my new website and podcast covering the weekly comic books. As you may know from some of my blog posts, I recently got back to into comics a few months ago and now I'll be producing a weekly podcast covering my view of the weeks comics from the eyes of a new comic reader. Bare with me as I try to get everything working smoothly. I hope to polish my public speaking skills, get more comfortable working in Garageband, and get on a solid release schedule, but the first episode is up and you subscribe to the podcast in <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=258091365">iTunes</a> or just stream it from the <a href="http://www.professorsexinthetoiletwiththelawnmower.com/">webpage</a>.
