<a href="http://www.ridethebandwagon.com">Bandwagon</a>, the iTunes backup program, has finally released their version of software that supports backup to an FTP server. They have had a version that supported Amazon's S3 service for a couple months now but now you can backup to any FTP server including another computer on your local network. I tested it last night by backing up my iTunes music to a Buffalo Linkstation I have on my LAN. The 40 gigs of data took about 2 hours to backup so speed was good. I'm probably going to try a backup to my Dreamhost site soon but thats going to take some time. Everything worked great except the app was always at 100% CPU usage when it was running. The program is in beta so bugs are expected. For a first release tho, it offers a great way to backup your iTunes library locally or offsite.

Also they are offering a free 6 months to any blogger who posts about the release. Just make a post, not unlike this one, and post a trackback to the <a href="http://blog.ridethebandwagon.com/2007/06/22/bandwagon-ftp-edition-beta-available/">post</a> on their blog and you will get a code good for a 6 months free.
