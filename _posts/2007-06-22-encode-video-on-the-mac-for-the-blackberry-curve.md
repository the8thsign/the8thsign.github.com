I've whipped up a Workflow for encoding videos for the Blackberry Curve. You will need to <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2006/11/22/encode-video-for-the-blackberry-pearl-8100-mac-edition/">head over to my post on encoding video for the Blackberry Pearl for instructions</a> but here is an updated Workflow that should format videos to the correct screen size. I do not have a Curve to test this so if anyone has one and would like to give me feedback, I'd appreciate it.
