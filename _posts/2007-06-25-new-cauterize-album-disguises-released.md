One of my favorite bands, <a href="http://www.cauterize.com">Cauterize</a>, has recently released a new album called Disguises. This is the first album released on Darrin Pfeiffer of Goldfinger's label High 4 Records. First off after looking at the track list you notice that its basically their independent release <em>Paper Wings</em> with 4 new tracks. Since I have <em>Paper Wings</em>, the album doesn't do too much for me. When broken down there are 4 new songs, 2 re-recorded songs and 6 remastered songs. The new songs are good with my favorite song on the whole album being Don't Stop Now. My favorite song off of<em> Paper Wings</em>, Closer, was also re-recorded and will serve as the first single off the album. For being one of my favorite bands, its sucks a little to only get 4 new tracks after 2 years but the new songs are awesome. Don't Stop Now and Slivers rock. The band has gotten heavier with there sound over the years and it really shows.

Since I was one of the first 500 people to pre-order the new CD, I was send a 5 song acoustic CD called Unmasked. Also both CD covers have been autographed by the band which was a nice touch. If anyone wants to check them out, go to their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cauterized">Myspace</a> page to stream some tracks from the new album.
