Comic Collector Live, the Windows only database program for comic books has finally launched their Live Market. Live Market sets out to be eBay for comics. This is the one feature I have been waiting for as I have a lot of comics I would like to sell. As soon as I got the email, I booted up Vista via Boot Camp and installed the new version of Comic Collector Live. From there it took no more than 10mins to setup a sellers account. Right now they have two different packages - a $14.95 all you can eat plan and a $0.25 pay per listing plan. If you're going to sell any more than a handful of comics, the $14.95 seems the better deal as it is only $0.01 to sell and the listing doesn't expire. Otherwise, its a standard 7 day listing. Selling comics is easy if you have already entered the comic into the program, just click sell and then rate your comics condition. You can rate individual comics or as a group. Also, you can sell individually or as a lot.

Right now I only have up the first 15 issues of Venom as I was playing around but in the next week or so I plan on going through my books and selling anything I don't wait. From the stats on the homepage, it doesn't look promising. As of this writing there are 1095 items for sales and only 33 sold. The site did just launch so hopefully over the next few days, the user base will increase. I'm going to give the service a month to see how I make out. Its too bad this is a Windows only, it would be made a great Web app.
