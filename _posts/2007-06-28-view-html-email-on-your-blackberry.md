Lack of HTML formated email on your Blackberry got you down? You're not alone.  Due to security concerns, Blackberry's do not offer HTML support in emails at all. Even in its consumer phones, the Pearl and Curve, HTML email isn't even an option. Unfortunately, a lot of email sent these days have some sort of HTML in them and the lack of support makes those emails hard to read when using a Blackberry.

Enter the <a href="http://www.getempower.com/wordpress/">Empower HTML Mail Viewer</a>. This piece of software installs as a plugin to the Blackberry mail client and displays HTML formated email the way it was meant. The product is in beta and its shows.There have been some obvious problems with previous builds. Fortunately the latest beta has fixed most of the bugs that caused me to disable the plugin while I was testing it. The only issue I have left is pictures do not display at all. You just get an outline of a box. The program is yet to be perfected but even in the beta form, its usefulness easily outweighs some minor issues. If you want to enter the world of HTML email, just point your Blackberry to <a href="http://www.getempower.com/emv.php">http://www.getempower.com/emv.php</a> and install OTA. I would be sure to bookmark the page and check back for any updates as there has been 2 in the last week that have fixed numerous bugs.
