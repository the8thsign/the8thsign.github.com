Apple's long awaited iPhone was released yesterday after much hype. From most of the reviews I've been reading, it lives up to the hype too. Even with all the glowing reviews, I'm going to pass on the iPhone, for now atleast. My dependance on my Blackberry is enough to keep me away. I currently have a Blackberry Pearl and I'm still In love with my phone after 9 months. Its coming up on having the phone for a year so I'm itching for a new phone but the iPhone's lack of Exchange or OWA support makes it a deal breaker to me. I'm definitely jealous of anyone who has an iPhone but I can't justify paying $600 to lose a feature I depend on so much.

On a side note, its been <a href="http://blackberrycool.com/2007/06/29/004976/">confirmed</a> that a 2nd gen Blackberry Curve will be coming to T-Mobile in September. I will be getting this phone once its released for sure. New features in the updated Curve include:
<ul>
	<li>Wi-Fi</li>
	<li>3.2MP camera</li>
	<li>Stereo Bluetooth</li>
	<li>Improved build quality</li>
</ul>
As long as I'm at my current job, I'm going to be sticking with a Blackberry but damn do I want a iPhone.
