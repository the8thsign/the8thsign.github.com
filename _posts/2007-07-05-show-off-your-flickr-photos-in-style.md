The folks from <a href="http://123flickr.com/">123flickr</a> have released a new service at  <a href="http://host.123flickr.com/">host.123.flickr.com</a> that takes your Flickr account and gives it a "dynamic, functional, cool interface".  All you need to do is go to <a href="http://host.123flickr.com/">host.123flickr.com</a>, enter the URL to your Flickr account, then it will generate a page for you complete with a URL you can give out or link to. Its a great way to show off your Flickr photos as a gallery. You can see my page <a href="http://host.123flickr.com/40284913@N00">here</a>. A few drawbacks I've seen so far is that it will only show the first 30 pictures from any of your sets, it will not show pictures that are not in sets and there is no way to go from one picture to another without going back to the main page. Otherwise its a nice way to show off your portfolio to friends, family or potential clients.
