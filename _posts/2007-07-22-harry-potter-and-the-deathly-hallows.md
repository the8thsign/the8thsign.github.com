After 10 years, the Harry Potter series finally came to an end on Friday. I took a half a day at work to I could get in line at the local Barnes and Noble to pick up my copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows promptly at midnight. After some dinner we headed to B&amp;N and walked around for the next hour or so while we waited for the magic hour. I had reserved the book but I was in group "I" due to getting to the store so late. After getting the book at around 1am, my excitement was foreshadowed by Amy noticing she did not have her wallet anymore, we went back to Pasta Fair and thankfully they had her wallet in the safe. So crisis averted and it was back to Harry Potter on the brain.

Now, mind you, I can't read book 7 due to having never read book 6. I've read up to Order of the Phoenix but never got around to reading Half-Blood Price even tho I bought it at midnight the last time there was a Potter Party. My plan was to watch the OOP movie which came out last week to job my memory of book 5, then read book 6 while Amy read book 7. This way by the time I was finished with Half-Blood Prince, she would be done with the last book and I could start in on that too. As of now I'm half way done with book 6 and should be finished by next weekend. I can only hope I can keep up my media blackout of all things Harry Potter until I finished the final book.
