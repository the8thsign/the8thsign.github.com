When a lead singer goes off to do a solo album, its pretty much a death-toll for the band. For Rilo Kiley it seems to be just what the band needed. After 3 years since their last album, they are back with what is the Album of the Year for me. <em>Under The Blacklight</em> is a grownup Rilo Kiley who have taken their sound to the next level. With what is sure to cause some tension with long time fans, <em>Under The Blacklight</em> mixes decades of styles to Rilo Kiley's indie sound. The first cry is going to be "sell out" as this is the first album signed to major label Warner Bros. but anyone who actually knows, their last album <em>More Adventurous</em> was distributed by Warner Bros also.

Every song on the album is distinctive and rememberable. The first single off the album is the sexy and sulty "The Monkeymaker" which is my current favorite. The title track "Under The Blacklight" is a contemporary Kay Hanley-esqe song that allows Jenny to really show off her voice. "Dreamworld" is  dreamy mashed-duet between Lewis and Sennett. Another favorite of mine is the ska influenced To Catch a Predator anthem "15" which Jenny's cracking voice leaves you with impure thoughts. The last track "Give a Little Love" is a perfect ending track that gives us a little 80's love.

Track Listing:

1. "Silver Lining"
2. "Close Call"
3. "The Moneymaker"
4. "Breakin' Up"
5. "Under The Blacklight"
6. "Dreamworld"
7. "Dejalo"
8. "15"
9. "Smoke Detector"
10. "The Angels Hung Around"
11. "Give A Little Love"

I hate to make this comparison, but this feels very similar to what My Chemical Romance did with there experimental album <em>The Black Parade</em>. Each song is new and fresh. You can tell band is having fun playing all these songs. Jenny really shows off her vocal talents by mixing up different styles. There is something for everyone here, even die-hard fans who feel they sold-out. This is easily the Album of the Year in my eyes and 2008 is going to be the year of Rilo Kiley.
