NBC Universal is looking to <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/31/say-bye-bye-to-heroes-nbc-to-end-itunes-show-sales/">not renew</a> its contact with Apple in regards to its Television content this December. Last season I purchased full seasons of Lost, Heroes, The Office, Studio 60 and Battlestar Galactica, mostly all NBC shows, from iTunes. I canceled cable and even bought an AppleTV. So you can expect, I'm a little pissed about this. If NBC wants more money, they are in ever right to ask for it and take it somewhere else if they are not happy. But if they pull from iTunes, I'll have to resort to torrents for these files now. So Universal, since you're so interested in dollar figures, what's better...$1.99 of my money in your pocket or losing the war on piracy? When will companies learn that downloading shows via bitorrent isn't about stealing, its about convenience. And I would gladly pay $1.99 an episode for convenience, especially with all the promising upcoming shows this season.
