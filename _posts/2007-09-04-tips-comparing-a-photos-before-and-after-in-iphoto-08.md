One of my favorite features in iPhoto is its ability to compare changes you've made to the original with the press of a button. In previous versions, it was assigned to the CTRL key. With iPhoto '08, this no longer works. For days I was hating the new iPhoto because it seemed they removed this feature. After a little digging around, I found that Apple has not removed the feature but just moved it to the SHIFT key. I've actually found this to be a welcome change as I check against the original a lot and the SHIFT key is much easier to locate and press.
