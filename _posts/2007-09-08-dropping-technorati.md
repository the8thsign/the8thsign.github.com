As of today, I will be dropping Technorati tags in my posts. They have become too much of a hassle with very little benefit. I've been planning on doing it for a while but a <a href="http://www.skelliewag.org/50-tips-to-unclutter-your-blog-44.htm">recent blog post on Skelliwag</a> gave me the push I needed. In addition I've made a few other small changes that should help with navigation.
