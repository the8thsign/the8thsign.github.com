Its been a hell of a year for Apple to say the least. iPhone, AppleTV, redesigned iMacs, Leopard, full iPod refresh including the long awaited iPod Touch. But what's left? We are only 4 months from Macworld 2008 and I cannot think of what Apple has up its sleeve. There are a few product lines that could use a refresh, Macbook/Mac Pro, but redesigns would hardy be Macworld worthy. Either Macworld 2008 is going to be lackluster compared to the last few years or we can expect some big surprises.
