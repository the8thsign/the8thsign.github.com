Wordpress 2.3 was <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-23/">released </a>yesterday and using the <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/">Automatic Upgrade plugin</a>, the upgrade was fast and painless. The only plugin I needed to upgrade was <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/">Google (XML) Sitemaps Generator</a>. I've added tag support into the sites theme and I'm slowly moving categories and old technorati tags over to the new tagging system. So expect some weirdness for the next few days as I go through 400+ posts and tag them. I'll be completely dropping categories in favor of tags as soon as I'm finished.
