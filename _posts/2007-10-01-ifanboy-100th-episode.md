Friday night I headed down to <a href="http://http//www.jhuniverse.com/">Jim Hanley's Universe</a> in NYC for the <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/archive/weblog/its_the_ifanboy_1.html">100th episode of the iFanboy Pick of the Week podcast</a>. The show itself was awesome and was nice to see one of my favorite podcasts live. I didn't actually talk to anyone there like an ass but it was still good times. The <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/archive/weblog/its_the_ifanboy_1.html">podcast is now up</a> if you would like to listen to it. There is also a good chance it will make the video show where you'll probably see me standing off to the side. After the show everyone went to Stout down the street but unfortunately I had my underage niece's with me so we had some sushi in the city then headed home. I did end up picking up New Frontier Vol 1 and 2 and Kingdom Come trades to help feed my current DC fixation with the handy dandy <a href="http://www.ifanboy.com/jhu/">20% off coupon</a> iFanboy was offering.
