So <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3704301">Google gobbled up</a> Finish microblogger <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> today. I'm a user of <a href="http://twitter.com/the8thsign">Twitter</a> but I do have a <a href="http://the8thsign.jaiku.com/">Jaiku account </a>and actually like what Jaiku is doing. They offer more of a Twitter+LIfestream experience that Im interested in but just like Pownce, all my friends are on Twitter so thats where I am. One of the more interesting features that Jaiku does is <a href="http://jaiku.com/mobile">Jaiku Mobile</a>, which offer integration into your cell phone. Only Nokia phones are supported at this time but here is an excert right from Jaiku about what Jaiku Mobile is:
<blockquote>Jaiku Mobile works like the phone's regular phone book, and enhances the standard contact list with presence information. It displays the buddy icon, availability, latest Jaiku message, and location for you and your Jaiku contacts in your contact list. It enables you to

* Browse and post Jaikus
* Add comments
* Share your availability based on your ring profile (green light = ringing, yellow light = vibrate, red light = silent)
* Share your location (neighborhood, city, country) based on cellular network towers
* Share your calendar events (if you don't want to share your calendar, Jaiku only displays your status as "busy" when an event is active)
* Share who you're with based on nearby Bluetooth devices</blockquote>
Imagine that you pull up a contact on your iPhone and it shows the person is at work based on the cell tower they are on. But it also shows that their last update says "Lunch" so you know you can call. Or it reads their calendar and marks them as busy because they're in a meeting. That's epic. There has been a lot of take about a gPhone from Google and I can only wish something like this makes it into there. Even better would be Google and Apple getting together to make this work on the iPhone.

I'm going to wait and see what Google has in-store for Jaiku just like everyone else but if you are on Jaiku and would like to add me, my username is <a href="http://the8sign.jaiku.com">the8thsign</a>. If you a Mac user, check out the Twitterific-esque client <a href="http://juhu-mac.blogspot.com/">Juhu</a>.
