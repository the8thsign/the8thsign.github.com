Friday night I headed down to the Danbury, CT Apple Store for the Leopard release event. The store was closed from 4:00pm to 6:00pm so they could prepare for the release. I ended up going down for 3:00pm because I made a Genius Bar appointment so they could take a look at my <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/2007/10/29/iphone-part-deux/">iPhone which was suffering from the negative black screen issue</a>.

I plopped down in line right after the Apple Store closed, I was 4th in line of about 100 people. The 2 kids in front of my weren't even there to buy Leopard. One had received it earlier that day in the mail and the other just wanted a free t-shirt. The guy behind me had just recently returned a Vitsa machine he had nothing but problems with and was there to purchase his first Mac, so I was giving him some advise and telling him about the difference's between Mac and PC's. During the whole time, Apple employees were handing out waters to everyone in line and taking pictures.

6:00pm rolled around and they opened their door. I made a beeline right for the Leopard DVDs and think I was the first to purchase it. As much as I would have loved to stay and check out everything, I wanted to head home and install Leopard right away. So right after I got my DVD and Tshirt, I left for home.
