I never posted here when I got my iPhone for some reason. But now I'm on my 2nd iPhone and guess I should take the opportunity to talk about it.

After Apple's last major announcement, I was sold on the iPod Touch. I've written here before about my decision to not go with the iPhone but the Touch was perfect for me. Everything I wanted in the iPhone without changing cell phone providers. A few weeks later, the iPod Touch's were released and I was one of the first ones out of my local Apple store with one. The iPod Touch was the sexiest piece of hardware I have ever owned. After a few days of using it, I wanted more. WiFi access wasn't enough, I need always on access. All of a sudden the newly price dropped $399 iPhone was attractive. After a day of getting up the courage to switch carriers, I went to the Apple Store and returned my 16GB iPod Touch for a new 8GB iPhone.

Within a few hours, I had hacked the iPhone and enjoying 3rd party software along with my now always on access, Mail and other goodies like hacked ringtones that the iPod Touch didn't support. A week later, Apple release iPhone firmware version 1.1.1 and knowing it would kill my 3rd party apps, I installed it ASAP. For me, the 3rd party apps were a work in progress at best. There were a few apps I liked but none I couldn't live without. Even today I don't feel I'm missing out especially with Apple announcing official 3rd party support in February. Hopefully native apps for IM and Twitter will finally be a reality.

Enter my 2nd iPhone. A <a href="http://www.modifiedlogic.com/wordp2/archives/108">friend of mine</a> who bought an iPhone at the same time I did, was having issues with "negative blacks". He pointed me to a <a href="http://www.appleservedup.com/">website</a> that tested for this and sure enough, I was affected too. Most stuff was OK, but movies like 300 really showed the problem. I wasn't in too much of a rush to get my iPhone replaced so I waited a few weeks until I was going to be at the Apple Store again, for the release of Leopard.

Before the Apple store closed to prepare for Leopard, I made a Genius Bar appointment and had them look at my iPhone. I showed him <a href="http://www.appleservedup.com/">appleservedup.com</a> on my phone, he checked his and I had a new phone within a few minutes. I checked the site for blacks and dead pixels before I left and everything was perfect. Now I can finally apply my Invisible Shield thats been waiting patiently for me.
