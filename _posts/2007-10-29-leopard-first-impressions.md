Leopard is a milestone, not just for Apple, but for me too. Leopard is my first operating system I've ever purchased. I've played with a few beta's, both fresh installs and upgrade and it was something I was excited to see. When it was delayed, I let out a collective "sigh" as it was one of the things I've been looking forward to this year. Well the time has come and Leopard is my new operating system.<br />
<br />
The biggest decision with any new operating system is to update your current setup or do a fresh install. While the beta's updated without an issues, I decided to go a fresh install. I always welcome fresh starts and it would give me a chance to streamline my application needs. The couple days before Leopard was released I spend time cleaning up my hard drive so it would fit onto a 120GB external drive. After making the room, I used SuperDuper! to clone my Tiger install. When installing Leopard I did a Erase and Install and planned on using the Migration Assistant to copy my information back.<br />
<br />
After Leopard installed, I decided I wasn't going use the Migration Assistant because I didn't want all my old settings back. I still needed some data thought and I just copied stuff like my iTunes and iPhoto libraries back. My goal is to try and streamline my computing needs so I'm only installing programs as I need them. I hope to move to online services like Google Documents for some of my needs instead of keeping 2 or 3 different word processors on my hard drive like before.<br />
<br />
After getting some essentials installed, it was time to play around with the new features. To be honest, there wasn't too much right off the bat for me. I haven't tried Time Machine yet as my external HDD still is housing a image of my Tiger install. I moved back to iChat but I don't do any video chats and I still prefer Firefox over Safari. Obviously some of these might be useful in time but for now, I just don;t use them. That being said, the things I do use have made this upgrade well worth it in gold. First off is Spotlight. I used spot light as an application launcher and Apple has tweaked it so it now shows Applications before searching. This makes it on par with Quicksilver in application launching and with no software to install. But my favorite thing is the new Finder. I love this thing. Quicklook is by far the best feature in Leopard. The new iTunes like source list in Finder is much better than its predecessor. The fact you can see network shares in the source list is epic, very 1990's, but still epic to see in Finder finally. I'm loving the new iCal thought RememberTheMilk's feed does not seem to be updating now.<br />
<br />
I've not been without my problems. Mostly minor like applications such as Popcorn not running. One thing that got me worried was last night. I shut my laptop lid and my laptop went into sleep. About 10 minutes later I keep hearing the sound the DVD drive makes when it checks for a disc. After about the 4th time I got up and looked. After a few minutes, the DVD drive would check for a DVD like it was waking up and I'd see the Apple light up. For some reason, the laptop was trying to wake up then go right back to sleep every few minutes. I opened the lip and shutdown the computer and left it. I'll see what happens tonight.<br />
<br />
Overall I'm very impressed with the update. Stuff like Time Machine I know I'll love when I start using it and as more applications are released to support it, the application compatibility issue should go away. As soon as Google enabled IMAP on my account, I'm going to start using Mail and kick the tires on that for awhile. There is some stuff that still doesn't make since to me like iChat not being about to handle AIM and Jabber lists in one window and Safari not being about to open links in tabs. Stuff like that was fixed with 3rd party apps in Tiger and I'm sure those apps will be updated for Leopard soon.<br />
