<p>I few weeks ago I discovered <a href="http://www.jott.com">Jott</a>, which I found to be amazing convenient when on the run. While it was good for sending me reminders and the occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/the8thsign">Tweet</a>, the one thing I found myself wanting is a way to Jott to my todo list. My todo list of choice just happens to be <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>. I tried to hack a Jott to RTM using my RTM email but that was a failure. So I sent an email to Jott a few weeks ago and lo and behold, they <a href="http://console.jott.com/blog/index.php/jottlink/you-asked-for-it-you-got-it/">added a Jott Link for Remember the Milk today</a>. It uses the RTM API so you can select where your tasks are saved. Right now it supports the task name, when it's due and what it's tagged with. If your a Remember the Milk user, the ability to call in your tasks epic.</p>
