<p>Earlier this year I started a comic podcast over at <a href="http://www.professorsexinthetoiletwiththelawnmower.com">www.professorsexinthetoiletwiththelawnmower.com</a>. I got a couple episodes out but the time it took to produce and the fact it was no fun doing it alone, I kinda stepped back from it until I can devote the time and resources needed.  Right now the site is being used as a starting ground for stuff I would want to do in the future but thats about. </p>

<p>In the meantime, to satisfy my comic blog itch, I've signed on to be a regular contributor over at <a href="http://www.comicspoilers.net">www.comicspoilers.net</a>. I have 5 posts up already and plan on at least 1 new post a week but most likely more depending on the given week.</p>
