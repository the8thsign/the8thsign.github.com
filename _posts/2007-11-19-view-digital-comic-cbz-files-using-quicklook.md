<p>Digital comic files come in two flavors, CBZ and CBR. They are just renamed ZIP and RAR files containing JPG files. While Quicklook can look at JPG files, it cannot look into a compressed file for them. Over on the <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/8300945231/m/302003628831">arstechnica forums</a>, a user named gheritt has whipped up a Quicklook plugin that allows you to view CBZ files. It displays them inline similar to a PDF file. Only CBZ files work right now. There is no built-in support for RAR compression in OS X 10.5 so CBR files will not work, yet.</p>

<p>Download the file directly from <a href="http://dancingtortoise.com/apps/QuickComic.qlgenerator.zip">here</a> and install into /Library/Quicklook.</p>
