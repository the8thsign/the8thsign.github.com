<p>Timbuk2 recently contacted me about using one of my photos for a <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/">redesign of their webpage</a>. Of course I said yes as I love my Timbuk2 bag. Well today is the day they launched the new website and my picture is part of the header for the laptop section. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/laptop/">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>They also gave me a $125 gift card for using my picture and I made waste to that on a new <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/laptop/commute">Commute bag</a> and a <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/accessories/wallets/monroe-wallet">Monroe Wallet</a> in a matter of minutes. I love my Blogger but hoping the Commute will be a little smaller. I do like the fact it has a place for water bottles on the outside. I've also given up on <a href="http://www.thejimi.com/wallet/index.php">Jimi wallets</a> as they keep breaking on me so I'm going to try my luck with a wallet from Timbuk2. </p>
