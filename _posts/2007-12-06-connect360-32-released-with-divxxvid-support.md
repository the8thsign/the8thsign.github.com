<a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/connect360">Nullriver's Connect360</a> was just updated to version 3.2 adding support for Divx and Xvid files. Connect360 allows Mac users to stream Music, Video and Photos to a Xbox360. You will need to have the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemupdates/default.htm">Fall 2007 Dashboard update</a> installed on your Xbox360 but once you do, you will be able to stream Divx and Xvid encoded AVI files directly to your TV (finally!). The program costs $20 but they offer a trial version on their <a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/connect360">webpage</a>.
