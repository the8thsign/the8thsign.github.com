<a href="http://jott.com">Jott</a> is one of my favorite new services this year. Dial a 1-800 number, say who I want to Jott to and speak. In a few minutes my voice is translated into any number of web services Jott supports. Today they added support for Google Calendar so now I can create appointments when I'm on the run by just dialing a number and speaking. Saying "Steve Job's Macworld Keynote at 9 am on January 15th" is a lot easier than logging into Google Calendar and typing that all out on my iPhone. Thanks to Jott I can now <a href="http://www.the8thsign.com/">blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/the8thsign">tweet</a>, <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">add a todo</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">create an appointment</a> without typing a word. Best of all Jott is free.
