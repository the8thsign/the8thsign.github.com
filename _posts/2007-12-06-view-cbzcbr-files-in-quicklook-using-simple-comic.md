Simple Comic 1.7 build 0167 beta now has a bundled Quicklook plugin for both digital comic CBZ and CBR files built in. <a href="http://dancingtortoise.com/blog/">Simple Comic is currently at version 1.6.1 on their webpage</a> but if you go into the Preferences and click on the Beta Update Feed option under Advanced > Updates, you will be presented with the option to update to 1.7 the next time you launch the app. Once you install Simple Comic 1.7 beta, restart you Mac and you will now notice all CBZ/CBR files now have thumbnails and you can view them using Quicklook. While in Coverflow view, you will now be able to flip through pages without opening up the file too.
