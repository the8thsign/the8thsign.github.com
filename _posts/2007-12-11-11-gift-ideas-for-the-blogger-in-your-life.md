<h2>01: Blogging Software</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/ecto-shot-tm.jpg" height="171" width="275" border="0" alt="ecto-shot-tm.jpg" />
<p>The most important piece of software bloggers use is the software they write in. A lot of people use their blogging platforms built-in tools but that doesn't allow for offline writing. Any word processor will do, but software like <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> (Mac) or <a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/">Ecto</a> (Mac/Windows) is specifically designed to integrate with all the major blogging platforms to allow offline editing, direct posting and uploading pictures and files.</p>


<h2>02: Digital camera</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/51ttwvdgd3l.-aa280-.jpg" height="150" width="150" border="0" alt="51TTWVDGD3L._AA280_.jpg" />
<p>No fancy DSLR here, a Point and Shoot is what you want. Something small and light they can carry at all times. I current use a dated FujiFilm V10 but newer cameras like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/dp/B000Q30420/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1197357236&amp;sr=1-5">Canon SD850</a> are a great choice.</p>


<h2>03: Flickr Pro account</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/home-gift-promo-07.png.v2.png" height="50" width="270" border="0" alt="home_gift_promo_07.png.v2.png" />
<p>A blogger will store a lot of photo's over the life of a blog. Where better to store and share them than Flick. A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/gift/">Pro account</a> will set you back $24.95 for a full year but allow for unlimited uploads, storage, bandwidth and photosets.</p>


<h2>04: 1 Year of Webhosting</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-2.png" height="61" width="295" border="0" alt="Picture 2.png" />
<p>This can work two ways. First, if the Blogger in your life is using a hosted service like Wordpress.com or Blogger for their blog, then give then the gift of their own server and URL. Two of the most popular webhosts are <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> and <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/services/thehostingcard/">Media Temple</a>. Both provide an auto install of different blogging platforms for quick setup. If they already have their own server, then purchasing an addition year from their webhost is a great gift.</p>


<h2>05: I'm Blogging This T-Shirt</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/blogging-babydoll.jpg" height="211" width="220" border="0" alt="blogging-babydoll.jpg" />
<p>The "I'm Blogging This" T-shirt (<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/generic/5eb7/">men</a>/<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/ladies/6388/">women</a>) from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">Thinkgeek</a> lets the world know they are next to be blogged.</p>

<h2>07: ASUS Eee PC</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/41dtb1q0gl.-ss500-.jpg" height="275" width="275" border="0" alt="41dtB1q+0GL._SS500_.jpg" />
<p>Sometimes you just don't want to carry your laptop everywhere you go and forget about typing out a blog post on the iPhone. Enter the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y33CVM/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I3OWCX8IXE2PRC&amp;colid=208BZWGXWUSS8">ASUS Eee PC</a>. A 7" ultraportable laptop weighing just under two pounds. Its comes with Linux installed but includes drivers for Windows XP. If your adventous enough, you can try <a href="http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2007/11/12654/">installing Mac OS X</a> on it also.</p>


<p><h2>08: Timbuk2 blogger bag</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/4-f-nv-gr-nv.jpg" height="229" width="275" border="0" alt="4_f_nv-gr-nv.jpg" />Â </p>

Its a vertical computer bag with a padded compartment for a laptop. Its waterproof and quite roomy.</p>


<p><h2>09: Blub to turn blog into a book</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/form-handsandbook.jpg" height="102" width="275" border="0" alt="form_handsAndBook.jpg" /></p>

<h2>10: 3G Card USBConnect 881</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/att-3g-options1.jpg" height="252" width="275" border="0" alt="att-3g-options1.jpg" />
<p>Having always on, everywhere access is still a few years away but for now <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?device=AT%2526T+USBConnect+881&amp;q_sku=sku1120017">AT&amp;T's USBConect 881 3G card</a> hits the spot. Its fast and portable so no matter if your lugging your Macbook Pro around or just decided to toss the Asus Eee PC in your pocket, you will always have a fast internet connection with you wherever you go.</p>


<h2>11: RSS reader</h2><img src="http://www.the8thsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/netnewswire1.jpg" height="143" width="275" border="0" alt="NetNewsWire.jpg" />
<p>While there are some great online RSS readers, the ability to read RSS feeds offline plus OS and application integration is perfect for productivity. My two favorite standalone programs are from Newsgator, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx">FeedDemon for Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx">NetNewsWire for Mac</a> both which sync to Newsgator's free online RSS reader.</p>
