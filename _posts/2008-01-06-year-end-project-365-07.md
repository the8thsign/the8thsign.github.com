<p>With the end of 2007 comes the end of my Project 365 photography experiment. One picture a day for one year. While it doesn't sound hard, it really became a challenge to find something new to photograph each day. As much fun as it was, I'm glad its over. I learned a lot about my Fuji V10 and when I finally switch to a DSLR, I may do another Project 365. Overall it was a great way to learn about my camera capabilities and also keep a daily photolog of my day to day life. I will almost definitely do another one when I purchase a DSLR but this year, I'm going to enjoy the time off.</p>
