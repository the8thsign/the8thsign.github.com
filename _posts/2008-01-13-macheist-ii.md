<p>The <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">MacHeist</a> II bundle sale has been underway for the last few days. I purchased last years bundle and it was well worth it. This years apps seems less appealing to me but I made the purchase anyways. Pixelmator, which is still locked at the moment, and AppZapper are the only ones I'm really interested in but the donation to the Humane Society is well worth it.</p>

<p>If you plan on purchasing the MacHeist bundle, I'd appreciate it if you could use my <a href="https://www.macheist.com/buy/invite/71045">link</a>.  </p>
