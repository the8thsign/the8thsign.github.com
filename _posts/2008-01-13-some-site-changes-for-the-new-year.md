title: 'Some site changes for the new year'

---

<p>I've been tweaking the site for the past few weeks with some small but noticeable changes. </p>

<ol><li>I finally fix the nasty IE6 CSS bug that was causing the sidebar to be pushed all the way to the bottom.</li>
<li>Since my Project 365 is over, the photos in the sidebar will now reflect my current photostream from Flickr.</li>
<li>Thanks to a suggestion by <a href="http://www.bentcorner.com/2007/12/31/comment-moderation-is-for-asshats/">Rick over at Bent Corner</a>, I've turned off comment moderation and installed a Captcha plugin for comments. </li>
<li>Updated sites under "The Social" section to be current.</li></ol>

<p>Please let me know if anything is not working correctly. More specifically, how the captcha plugin is working out for everyone.  </p>
