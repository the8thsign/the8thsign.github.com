<p>With 2007 as nothing more than fading memory, 2008 rolls on. I thought I had one of the best years in recent memory last year. I did a lot of stuff I set out to do, and even more I didn't expect. </p>

<p>I feel 2008 is going to be a slow year for me as I have some very specific goals that I plan on obtaining. The most prevalent is to become debt free. I've been working on this since 2005 and I hope for it to culminate this year. Unfortunately for this to happen, I have to be tight with my budget so I don't see a lot going on this year for me.</p>

<p>That being said, this year is already taking a few left turns. I will be starting a new job this year as mine is currently in the processes of being outsourced. I've already been on a couple interviews and there is one job I'm still interviewing for that I'm very excited for. I don't want to jinx myself but if I get it, I think its just what I need to start off the year right.</p>

<p>On the tech side of the coin, I'm not sure what to expect this year. One product that I would love to see with some changes this year is <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/">GrandCentral</a>. The Google owned product has been stagnant since they purchased it and I can only hope thats due to a major overhaul going on. Some of the features I would love to see is better iPhone support, SMS support and the ability to have calls auto-answer instead of having to accept them. I was also thinking about getting another computer this year but my Macbook is still going strong and I have no real reason to upgrade. Maybe when my living situation settles down, I'll look at a new computer. Other than that I'm just going to sit back and see what happens. </p>

<p>Overall I think this is going to be a year of focus for me. I'm turning 30 this year and need to start thinking about what's ahead. The past few years I've taken a lot of steps to declutter my life, straighten out my finances and set some goals. I plan on focusing on tying up any and all loose ends this year and starting off my 30's brand new. </p>
