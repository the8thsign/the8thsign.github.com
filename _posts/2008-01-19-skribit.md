<p>I recently got an invite to <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/">Paul Stamatiou's</a> new startup service <a href="http://skribit.com/">Skribit</a>. Skribit in its basic form is a widget that allows blog readers to make suggestions or vote on what topics they would like to see covered. One of my new year's resolutions was to blog more but I usually only write about stuff that catches my interest. I've installed the widget in the sidebar and have added some idea's I've had floating around. My readers, thats you guys, can either vote on what you would like to see or even better, make your own suggestions. I have a decent readership but I'm not sure its big enough for Skribit to work for me. I'm going to leave the widget up for a few months and see how it works out.</p>
