<p>Anyone that follows this blog or my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/the8thsign">Twitter</a> account knows I've been looking for a new job lately. My current job with Ann Taylor as a Help Desk Specialist is being outsourced in a few short months and I decided to get the hell out of dodge while I could. After 3 interviews, a tech screening, and some anxiety I'm happy to say I was offered a position at Apple as a Mac Genius in their Danbury, CT store last week. I happened to be on vacation last week so I didn't put my notice in at work until this Monday. My last day at Ann Taylor was today. I'm going to miss the people I work with but I couldn't wait to get away from that job. I hope to start with Apple next Monday and I'm very excited. I took a small pay cut but I'm going to be a million times more happy at Apple on my worst day than the best day at Ann Taylor. I should know some more details in the next few days but sometimes next month, I get to go to the Mothership (Cupertino, CA) for training. </p>
