Thanks to my new job , I get to spend the next 3 weeks in the San Jose area while I go for training. I left today and should be back on March 8th. Currently I'm in Chicago, waiting on my flight to San Jose. 

Since I was told Tuesday I was leaving this weekend, I haven't really had the time to make any plans for while I'm in CA. While I'm sure most of my weekdays will be filled with studying, I do plan on going out on the weekends. I'll have a rental car but its shared between 5 of us. My first order of business will be to get into San Francisco next weekend for WonderCon and hopefully headed to one of the iFanboy party's at night. Other than that, I really have no plans but I'm sure I'll figure something out.
