<p>Wordpress 2.5 was released last night which I promptly upgraded using the awesome <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-plugin.html">Wordpress Automatic Upgrade</a> plugin. Upgrade went great with no issues so far. I had been testing the RC's on a test account for about a week so I was prepared for what was coming. I did have some minor issues with my theme, which makes no sense, but thanks to <a href="http://www.robblatt.com">Rob</a>, he fixed most of the issues. There still is one issue that I think I know what's causing it but no idea how to fix it. Its small enough that you probably won't notice it even tho you're seeing it as you read this. I haven't decided if I'll just let it be or remove the CSS code totally. Time will tell.</p>

<p>I've also moved from my web host from Dreamhost to Media temple. I did this last week and it went very smoothly mostly due to learning from my last move. I got a lot of questions on why I decided to switch because I never had any issues with Dreamhost. Mostly was because media temple contacted me after a previous post and send me a  t-shirt and note thanking me for mentioning them. That is the kinda company I want to give my money too. I'm also a sucker for any company with an iPhone interface. So far I've been very happy with the change and my blog does seem a little more snappy when loading.</p>

<p>To segue into the next thing, I was driving to work when I had a awesome idea for a domain name. I broke out the iPhone and loaded up media temple to buy a domain name. Of course, the site was already taken by a cybersquatter. This is the 2nd domain I want that is rotting away due to these cockgobblers. Dammit! </p>
