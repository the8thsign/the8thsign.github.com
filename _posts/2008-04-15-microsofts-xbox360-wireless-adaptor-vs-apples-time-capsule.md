<p>After months of putting off buying the Xbox360's wireless adaptor due to it being overpriced, I finally just gave up and bought one. Happy to finally get rid of the Linksys Wireless-G Game Bridge that has been a problem since day one, it was just my luck to discover that I couldn't connect to my wireless network. After about an hour of trying everything I could, I gave a quick google search and discovered others were having problems connecting to an Apple Time Capsule router also. I had waited so long to get the wireless adaptor for the 360 that I wasn't going to give up. </p>

<p>My Time Capsule is basically an Apple Airport Extreme 802.11n Router with a hard drive built in. The router supports 802.11 a/b/g/n while the 360's wireless adaptor supports a/b/g. My laptop is a/b/g and the only other device I connect wirelessly is my iPhone which is b/g. This left me with a few choices. Currently I run the Time Capsule in 802.11n with b/g compatibility running at 2.4Ghz. </p>

<p>I'll spare the details of the hours of headache trying to get this to work by saying this: <strong>the Xbox360's Wireless Adaptor does not work with Time Capsule</strong>...yet. Well thats not entirely true. Lets looks at what options we have:</p>

<p>802.11n (2.4Ghz) = Not Supported</p>
<p>802.11n (5Ghz) = Not Supported</p>
<p>802.11n (802.11b/g compatible) (2.4Ghz) = Not Working</p>
<p>802.11n (802.11a compatible) (5Ghz) = Not Working</p>
<p>802.11b/g (2.4Ghz) = Not Working</p>
<p>802.11a (5Ghz) = Not Working</p>
<p>802.11g (2.4Ghz) = Not Working</p>
<p>802.11b (2.4ghz) = Working</p>

<p>So out of 8 modes, 6 of which are supported, only 1 mode works. 802.11b is the only mode that allows the Xbox360 wireless to connect. Pretty worthless. Right now this looks to be a Microsoft problem as there are reports of the wireless adaptor not connecting to other draft N routers. Hopefully Microsoft will add support for Time Capsule in the Spring Dashboard update like they added support for Airport Extreme 802.11n routers in the Fall Update back in December. Until its fixed, you will either have to run your wireless network in 802.11b only mode or hardwire the Xbox360 using Cat5.</p>
