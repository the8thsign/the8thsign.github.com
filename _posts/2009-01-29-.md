Woopra is a new Web Anaylistic program that allows for realtime viewing of your webpage. 

It runs as a Desktop app on your computer giving to access to realtime stats. It relies on Java to make it cross platform. Woopra does a great job of keeping up with development using the latest version of Java 1.6. This if fine and dandy and really doesn't mean much for most people execept that Sun has yet to release Java 1.6 for 32bit processors on the Mac. So everyone using PPC or an Intel Core Duo processor are left without any way to run the Woopra Desktop app. 

Woopra suggests using Parallels to run it but that means a little excessive to me. At best it requires $200 of software to run a free program.  This is 2008 and if something doesn't work, someone will make it work and usually post it online for free. That something is Soylatte. Its a X11 port of Java 1.6 to run on 32bit Intel Macs.
