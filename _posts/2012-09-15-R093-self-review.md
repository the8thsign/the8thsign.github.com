#What were your key achievements?
Becoming Lead Genius - Easily the highlight of my year was becoming Lead in October. I've been in the role less than 1 year but I've already learned and developed more in that short time than I did in all the 4 years before that. Its both challenging and rewarding at the same time. Most of my opportunities as a Genius were around leadership competencies and Lead has caused me to really move from being an individual contributor and focus on leadership and team building.

Red Zone Promoter - On a minor scale, another personal goal of mine was to receive a Red Zone Promoter for a sale. This allowed me to listen to every customer's needs and try and help them myself. This ranged from anything as ringing someone up in Etc for a case, to allowing myself to be accessible for questions to a Specialist to help them with their sale. This enabled to get 3 Promoters with comments in the last 12 months.

I was voted as "Most Likely to Work in Cupertino" by my peers this year. While I know a piece of paper will not actually get me there, I'm honored to be thought of by my peers as someone who has the talent, motivation and attitude to move up in Apple. 

Attending T3 Training and Retail Leadership Essentials has helped me make the transition from a peer to a leader. Recently RLE had me look at my MBTI and taught me Situational Leadership which has greatly increased my knowledge on how to handle peers in situations which I previously would shy away from. Learning my MBTI and completing my Learning Blueprint has changed the way I look at my own personal development. 

#What didn't you achieve that you wanted to?
Participate in a New Store Opening. 

I had turned down a request for emerging leader to focus on Lead last year and would of liked to re-visit that before our market change ended the program.

#In what ways did you develop this year?
Transition to Lead has been more challenging than I thought. I came into Lead during a shift of in-store management and a shift in how the Lead role viewed throughout the business. Confidence and Presentation skills have improved for me when speaking to a group of people. 

#What other feedback or comments would you like to share?
The Lead position has become somewhat of an undefined role at Apple. Its means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. This is how I define my role: I view my job as to enable people to do your best work, to protect them from people who would try to undermine that, and try and make sure they have the tools and resources they need to get it accomplish. 

I have no interest in going into management at this time. 
 
#What goals would you like to have in place for the coming months?
My ultimate goal for Apple Retail now is to open a new store as the only Lead, preferable someone closer to home for me. This isn't something I'm focused on because its not something I can make happen on my own. But I will be ready if that opportunity arises. 
 
I'm also coming up on my 5 year anniversary with Apple and have been reflecting a bit over the past few weeks. Sitting down with this and giving a hard look at my Learning Blueprint made one thing clear to me: I am no longer content with doing good at work and instead would like to be doing good work. When I was younger and asked what I wanted to do with my life, I never answered " I want to drive wait time". I always answered "I want to help people". With my 5 year coming up, I'm at a crossroad as to what I want to do next. I do not know if that lies with Apple Retail, Apple Corp, or beyond. I've met all my professional goals I set out to attain when I joined Apple. My goal this year is to do good, interesting work; something I'm passionate about. What that actually means or looks like, I have no idea at this point.
